      Today,... Cubism looks different - looks richer and more comprehensive than it did in 1914 - as a result of its recasting and expansion by painters, sculptors, photographers, architects, musicians, poets, film-makers, graphic and fashion designers, as well as through its revision in countless books and exhibitions. It might be said that, insofar as Cubism is still vital to us, it remains part of our visual language and power of self-expression. Insofar as Cubism belongs to art history, it has ceased to function in this way and has become something one can reflect on and make sense of from another historical position. The myriad legacies of Cubism thus comprise an important expression of the achievements and disappointments of modernism in the twentieth century.

      For Ballet Mecanique Léger abandoned narrative conventions and made a time-based collage of abstract shapes, fragments of real objects, prismatic shots, moving body parts and machinery. These are presented in contrasting temporal modes - from rapid-fire cuts to steady rhythm to slow revolutions. The whole is a hymn to the energies of the modern machine age, but articulated ... through the formal devices of film and with a strong emphasis on human perception and action.

        The artwork, while both humorous and controversial, relayed the message Cattelan had intended. It showed MoMA as a tourist destination and not an artwork gallery. Like many cultural destinations, MoMA focused on the commodification of art and promoted self-gratification right to its core. More, the work exposed how museums affiliate with emblematic aesthetics from individuals to branded merchandise.
      </p>
      <p>
        The performance also showed the influence of celebrity artists and how they influence art direction and history. The Picasso mascot on the museum entrance denoted how art content shifted from its ethos to a subject that lacked ideas in the mid-1990s era. The amusing face of the mascot reflected the unseriousness and degrading of art.

        Robert Rauschenberg

        Bio

        <p>
          Robert Rauschenberg worked in a wide range of mediums including painting, sculpture, prints, photography, and performance, over the span of six decades. He emerged on the American art scene at the time that Abstract Expressionism was dominant, and through the course of his practice he challenged the gestural abstract painting and the model of the heroic, self-expressive artist championed by that movement.
        </p>
        <p>
          In his landmark series of Combines (1954–64) he mixed the materials of artmaking with ordinary things, writing, “I consider the text of a newspaper, the detail of photograph, the stitch in a baseball, and the filament in a light bulb as fundamental to the painting as brush stroke or enamel drip of paint.” In Bed (1955), for example, he covered a large wall-mounted board with a pillow and patchwork quilt which he then marked with graphite scrawls and exuberant lashings of paint, the latter perhaps an ironic nod to Abstract Expressionism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Born in Port Arthur, Texas, Rauschenberg studied at a variety of art schools including the experimental Black Mountain College outside of Asheville, North Carolina, where the artist and former Bauhaus instructor Josef Albers was his teacher. There, his mentors and collaborators included the composer John Cage, the artist Cy Twombly, and the choreographer Merce Cunningham, with whom he would collaborate on more than twenty dance compositions. Rauschenberg’s engagement with performance was enduring and a defining influence in his work. As his career began to gather steam in New York in the mid-1950s, he also began a crucial dialogue with the artist Jasper Johns that shaped the work of both: together the two artists pushed each other away from defined models of practice towards new modes that integrated the signs, images, and materials of the everyday world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Photography and printmaking were two of Rauschenberg’s abiding interests. In the 1958–60 series based on the thirty-four Cantos of Dante’s Inferno, he used a solvent to transfer photographs from contemporary magazines and newspapers onto drawing paper. The series is emblematic of a lifetime of experimentation with the ways the deluge of images in modern media culture could be transmitted and transformed.

        Romare Bearden

        Bio

        <p>
          Romare Bearden, in full Romare Howard Bearden, (born September 2, 1911, Charlotte, North Carolina, U.S.—died March 12, 1988, New York City, New York), American painter, whose collages of photographs and painted paper on canvas depict aspects of American black culture in a style derived from Cubism. He is considered one of the most important African American artists of the 20th century.
        </p>    
        <p>
          Bearden was born in North Carolina but grew up in New York City and Pittsburgh. He studied at the Art Students League in New York City with George Grosz (1936–37) and at Columbia University (1943). His early paintings were realistic and often religious in theme (e.g., The Annunciation, 1942). After military service during World War II, he lived in Paris (1950–51), studied at the Sorbonne, and traveled extensively in Europe. During this period he developed his mature, semiabstract collage style. He first achieved recognition in the mid-1940s, and by the 1960s he had come to be regarded as the preeminent collagist in the U.S.
        </p>
        <p>
          The narrative structure of Bearden’s paintings is simple and archetypal; ritual, music, and family are his pervasive themes. His works’ complexity lies in their poetic abstraction, in which layered fragments of colour and pattern evoke the rhythms, textures, and mysteries of a people’s experience (e.g., in Family, 1969).
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Bearden also was a songwriter and book illustrator, and he occasionally designed sets for the Alvin Ailey American Dance Company. In 1990 the Romare Bearden Foundation was established to promote his work and to support African American artists.

        Wangechi Mutu

      <div class="igBox displayNone">
        <p>
          Wangechi Mutu was born in 1972 in Nairobi, Kenya. In her collages, drawings, sculptures, and films, Mutu centers the female body to create powerful and self-possessed figures that are hybrids of human, plant, animal, and machine forms. Sampling from a diverse array of sources—from natural materials to fashion magazines, medical diagrams, and traditional African arts—the artist creates otherworldly realms that examine cultural identity, the feminine, colonial history, and global consumption.
        </p>
        <p>
          First recognized for her collage paintings, Mutu began her career combining ink and paint with fragments of images mined from fashion magazines, National Geographic, and vintage illustrations. With these materials, Mutu constructs elegant yet perverse female characters that subvert the ways in which Black and female bodies have been depicted, packaged, and consumed. The figures simultaneously embody the disjointed experience of navigating transnational identity, contemporary Africa, and Western preconceptions. Working extensively on nonabsorbent Mylar film, Mutu maneuvers colorful ink and paint on the surfaces of these works to build a fantastically dense and textured ground. In her varied sculpture practice, Mutu utilizes natural materials such as paper pulp and Kenyan soil while also working in monumental bronze. For her Sentinel series (2016–present), the artist creates regal and fierce abstract female forms made from clay, wood, and various found materials. Mutu describes these towering sculptures as guarding the very earth that they are made from; they serve as reminders of our relationship to the planet and harbingers of our environmental crisis. Mutu’s bronze works, such as The NewOnes, will free Us (2019) and MamaRay (2020), are supernatural humanoid figures that contest the traditional roles of women in art and propose alternative iconography and modes of representation as well as potential futures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mutu received a BFA from Cooper Union for the Advancement of the Arts and Science and an MFA from Yale School of Art. She lives and works in New York and Nairobi.

          Leonce Raphael Agbodjelou is one of the pre-eminent photographers of the Republic of Benin. Born in Porto-Novo in 1965, he was trained by his father, the world-renowned photographer Joseph Moise Agbodjelou (1912-2000). Leonce’s ongoing portraiture project, 'Citizens of Porto-Novo,' captures the people of Benin’s capital. Using a daylight studio and a medium format film, the artist interprets the experience of a generation caught between tradition and progress.
        </p>
        <p>
          Leonce is the founder and director of the first photographic school in Benin and has recently been appointed president of the Photographer's Association of Porto-Novo. His work has been exhibited at Saatchi Gallery London, Seattle Art Museum, Fowler Museum Los Angeles, Brooklyn Museum New York, Vitra Museum Basel, Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, Tel Aviv Museum of Art, Israel & Camden Arts Centre, London, among others.
