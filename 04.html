          Structuralism  
        </h3>
        <p>
          Twentieth‚Äêcentury school of critical thought. <strong>Ferdinand de Saussure</strong> argued that underlying the everyday use of language is a language system (langue), based on relationships of difference. He stressed the arbitrary nature of the relationship between the signifier (sound or image) and the signified (concept). Initially a linguistic theory, Claude L√©vi‚ÄêStrauss and Roland Barthes developed structuralism into a mode of critical analysis of cultural institutions and products. It is associated especially with the notion of a literary text as a system of signs.

          How does a Cubist picture get seen as a picture of something? (As opposed to being the thing itself)
        </h5>
        
        <p>
          For Braque, letters were "forms which could not be distorted because, being quite flat, they existed outside space and their presence in the painting, through contrast, enabled one to distinguish between objects situated in space and objects outside it".

        <p>The invention of collage in particular was not simply a negative gesture, for collage meant that art could be made in an entirely novel way. This new medium created a new understanding of form and simultaneously embodied - as will be seen - a new subject matter: the strangeness and complexity of modern life.

      The Grebo
    </h4>
    <p>
      The Grebo or Glebo people are an ethnic group or subgroup within the larger Kru group of Africa, a language and cultural ethnicity, and to certain of its constituent elements. They are principally located along the southern border region of Liberia and C'√¥te d'Ivoire
    </p>
    <p>
      The Grebo are known for their carved wooden masks, which were worn in ceremonies to mediate or propitiate the spirits. White clay is applied to participants in certain ceremonies, to denote a ku or spirit. Dancers wearing the carved masks are also daubed with it.

      <h5>Some context on why these masks were in France</h5>
      <h5>
        In the Ivory Coast:
      </h5>
      <p>
        "By the end of the 1880s, France had established control over the coastal regions... and in 1889 Britain recognized French sovereignty in the area. That same year, France named Treich-Lapl√®ne the titular governor of the territory. In 1893, Ivory Coast became a French colony..."
      </p>
      <p>
        "France's main goal was to stimulate the production of exports. Coffee, cocoa, and palm oil crops were soon planted along the coast. Ivory Coast stood out as the only West African country with a sizeable population of European settlers; elsewhere in West and Central Africa, Europeans who emigrated to the colonies were largely bureaucrats. As a result, French citizens owned one-third of the cocoa, coffee, and banana plantations and adopted the local forced-labour system."
      </p>
      <cite>
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory_Coast
      </cite>
      <h5>
        In Liberia
      </h5>
      <p>
        Not under French rule but American influence which, with "other international interests emphasized resource extraction, with rubber production a major industry in the early 20th century. In 1914, Imperial Germany accounted for three quarters of the trade of Liberia."
      </p>
      <cite>
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberia
      </cite>
    </div>
    <p>
      In other words, there is an established political and commercial system of exporting goods from these countries to Europe. Masks aren't exactly typical commodities of colonial trade / extraction, but this exchange still exists within this system.
    </p>
    <p>
      French artists would likely acquire these from merchants bringing goods in to seaside port towns.
    </p>
    <p>
      These masks would also be worn in ritual/ceremonial contexts that give them their spiritual and cultural value. Hung on a wall in a glass case, these masks are isolated from their context (imagine if aliens came to earth, brought back halloween masks to put in their museums, but didn't know about trick-or-treating).

            In this work two pieces of newspaper float within a charcoal drawing. The lower piece overlaps with the body of a violin, and has a small 'f' hole drawn on it as counterpart to a larger one to the right. The differential scale of the two holes is a clear semiotic suggestion that the front plane of the violin is not parallel to the picture plane, but instead turns into the 'depth' of the picture. The other newspaper fragment to the right of the violin is apparently in the background 'space'. [Rosalind] Krauss has pointed out that these two pieces are in fact cut from the same sheet of paper in a single act (two silhouettes are thus 'drawn' at once), but that one has been turned over to reveal its back. This act of flipping over the paper is a symbol for 'depth' rather than, as in the (minimal) case of the 'f' holes, a picture of it. Furthermore, the newspaper changes role according to its position: in the 'background' it is the void of shadow, in the body of the violin it is the solidity of wood. This to-and-fro of void and solid, of front and back, of depth and surface, is Picasso's way of including what is absent from Cubism, even if only by pointing at the other missing half of a presence (eg 'depth' where there is only surface). And his new way of pointing is symbolic, or thoroughly semiotic, rather than iconic, or by resemblance. The ability to conjure up semiotically what is outside the limits of representational picturing was now inaugurated by newspaper cuttings: the most abstract of pictorial things (depth, shadow, light, colour) could be 'said' if not shown through the most concrete of pictorial elements (outlines, planes and colours).
