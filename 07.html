        Artforms are rarely created in isolation, modern art is largely the product of international encounters, born of travel and exchange.
      </h5>
      <p>
        Art history is full of people visiting different countries, absorbing art and writing that was unavailable elsewhere, then returning home to produce their own variants. These variants, in reflecting the context of their time and place, might then grow into new movements. This is especially true of modern art in the early 1900s, as artists across the world crossed paths with Cubism.

          Some context
        </h5>
        <p>
          Like France, Italy was caught up in nationalist fervour leading up to WWI. Unlike France, it hadn't shown much for itself in modern art, it still represented the art of Ancient Rome and the Renaissance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Italy was also an early adopter of Fascism, keen to expand its footprint through aggression. Unlike other dictators, Mussolini tolerated Avant-Garde modernism for awhile, which made for a rare confluence of far-right politics and progressive, experimental aesthetics.

            A work that is not aggressive in character cannot be a masterpiece ... We want to glorify war - the world's only hygiene - militarism, patriotism, the destructive act of the anarchists, the beautiful ideas for which one dies, and contempt for women. We want to destroy museums, libraries, and academies of all kinds, and to make war on moralism, feminism and on every opportunistic and utilitarian vileness. We shall sing the great crowds excited by work, pleasure or rioting, the multicoloured, many-voiced tides of
            revolution in modern capitals. We shall sing the nocturnal, vibrating incandescence of arsenals. and shipyards, ablaze with violent electric moons, the voracious stations devouring their smoking serpents ... the broadbreasted locomotives that paw the grounds of their rails like enormous horses of steel harnessed with tubes, and the smooth flight of the aeroplanes, their propellers flapping in the wind like flags and seeming to clap approval like an enthusiastic crowd.

            An emphasis on synesthesia (the intermingling of different senses) and kinesthesia (the body's perception of motion).  
          </p>
          <p>
            "in contradistinction to [the notion that painting and sculpture as "static arts"] Futurism strove to incorporate the experience of simultaneity, temporality, and bodily movement within the boundaries of the art object.

      <h5 style="margin: 4rem 0;">
        In sum, Futurists sought art that expresses the novel experiences of 20th Century modernity - its new sights and sensations and ways of communicating.  
      </h5>
      
      
      <p>
        If Cubism responded to this condition by collapsing multiple spatial viewpoints into a flattened picture plane, and by playing with the linguistic structure of visual representation, Futurism sought to combine multiple visual moments in a single image, and to express the sensory immediacy of words and sounds.   
      </p>
      
      <div class="igBox">
        <p>
          What was Futurism offering to the world? Its basic views, amounting to an insistence that the growth of technology and concurrent developments in society and thought required expression in new, bold, art forms, were not unique but had never been presented so vehemently. Moreover, here was an art movement that put idea before style, thus challenging not only traditional artistic values but also the aesthetic ambitions of most avant-garde art. Futurist paintings tested and proved the possibility of using art as a means of capturing non-visual as well as visual aspects of an environment cognized as dynamic rather than static.

      Today, this might look like artists using apps and social media to distribute AI generated images. Making art is a way to engage with with the new ways technology mediates our changing reality, including the ways he communicate and create.     
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1909, this means looking at experiments in photography, inventions in mechanical engineering (e.g. cars, electric street lighting) and publishing manifestos in Newspapers.

          <p>
            Carra's Interventionist Demonstration is a central example of the Futurist aesthetic as it came to a climax just before World War I. Indeed, the work incorporates all of the devices with which Futurism was most engaged: the legacy of divisionist painting; the Cubist fragmentation of traditional perceptual space; the insertion of clippings from newspapers and found mate rials from advertising; the suggestion of kinesthesia through a visual dynamic set up by the collage's construction as both a vortex and a matrix of crisscrossing power lines set as mutually counter-active diagonals; and last, but not least, the juxtaposition of the separate phonetic dimension of language with its graphic signifiers. ... The juxtaposition of anti-German war slogans ("Down with Austro-Hungary") with found advertising material, or the concatenation of Italian patriotic declarations ("Italia Italia") with musical fragments, continues the technique of Cubist collage but turns this aesthetic into a new model of mass-cultural instigation and propaganda.
