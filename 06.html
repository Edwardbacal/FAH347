    <h5>
      Long answer:
    </h5>
    <p style="font-size: 5px;">
      In The Politics o f Aesthetics, Jacques Ranciere takes up this problem as in terms of the distribution of the sensible: I call the distribution of the sensible the system of self-evident facts
      of sense perception that simultaneously discloses the existence of
      something in common and the delimitations that define the respective
      parts and positions within it.5 A distribution of the sensible therefore
      establishes at one and the same time something common that is shared
      and exclusive parts. This apportionment of parts and positions is based
      on a distribution of spaces, times, and forms of activity that deter
      mines the very manner in which something in common lends itself to
      participation and in what way various individuals have a part in this
      distribution. Aristotle states that a citizen is someone who has a pa rt
      in the act of governing and being governed. However, another form of
      distribution precedes this act of partaking in government: the distri
      bution that [13] determines those who have a part in the community
      of citizens. A speaking being, according to Aristotle, is a political
      being. If a slave understands the language of its rulers, however, he
      does not ‘possess’ it. Plato states that artisans cannot be put in charge
      of the shared or common elements of the community because they do
      not have th e tim e to devote themselves to anything other than their
      work. They cannot be som ewhere else because work w ill not wait. The
      distribution of the sensible reveals who can have a share in what is
      common to the community based on what they do and on the time
      and space in which this activity is performed. Having a particular
      ‘occupation’ thereby determines the ability or inability to take charge
      of what is common to the community; it defines what is visible or not in a common space, endowed with a common language, etc. There is
      thus an ‘aesthetics’ at the core of politics that has nothing to do with
      Benjamin’s discussion of the ‘aestheticization of politics’ specific to
      the age of the masses’. This aesthetics should not be understood as
      the perverse commandeering of politics by a will to art, by a consid
      eration of the people qua work of art. If the reader is fond of analogy,
      aesthetics can be understood in a Kantian sense - re-examined perhaps
      by Foucault - as the system of a priori forms determining what presents
      itself to sense experience. It is a delimitation of [14] spaces and times,
      of the visible and the invisible, of speech and noise, that simultaneously
      determines the place and the stakes of politics as a form of experience.
      Politics revolves around what is seen and what can be said about it,
      around who has the ability to see and the talent to speak, around the
      properties of spaces and the possibilities of time.
      It is on the basis of this primary aesthetics that it is possible to raise
      the question o f‘aesthetic practices’ as I understand them, that is forms
      of visibility that disclose artistic practices, the place they occupy, what
      they ‘do’ or ‘make’ from the standpoint of what is common to the
      community. Artistic practices are ‘ways of doing and making’ that
      intervene in the general distribution of ways of doing and making as
      well as in the relationships they maintain to modes of being and forms
      of visibility. The Platonic proscription of the poets is based on the
      impossibility of doing two things at once prior to being based on the
      immoral content of fables. The question of fiction is first a question
      regarding the distribution of places. From the Platonic point of view,
      the stage, which is simultaneously a locus of public activity and the
      exhibition-space for ‘fantasies’, disturbs the clear partition of identities,
      activities, and spaces. The same is true of [15] writing. By stealing away
      to wander aimlessly without knowing who to speak to or who not to
      speak to, writing destroys every legitimate foundation for the circu
      lation of words, for the relationship between the effects of language
      and the positions of bodies in shared space. Plato thereby singles out
      two main models, two major forms of existence and of the sensible
      effectivity of language - writing and the theatre - , which are also
      structure-giving forms for the regime of the arts in general. However,
      these forms turn out to be prejudicially linked from the outset to a
      certain regime of politics, a regime based on the indetermination of identities, the delegitimation of positions of speech, the deregulation
      of partitions of space and time. This aesthetic regime of politics is
      strictly identical with the regime of democracy, the regime based on
      the assembly of artisans, inviolable written laws, and the theatre as
      institution. Plato contrasts a third, good form o f a rt with writing and
      the theatre, the choreographic form of the community that sings and
      dances its own proper unity. In sum, Plato singles out three ways in
      which discursive and bodily practices suggest forms of community:
      the surface of mute signs that are, he says, [16] like paintings, and
      the space of bodily movement that divides itself into two antagonistic
      models (the movement of simulacra on the stage that is offered as
      material for the audiences identifications and, on the other hand, the
      authentic movement characteristic of communal bodies).
      Here we have three ways of distributing the sensible that structure
      the manner in which the arts can be perceived and thought of as forms
      of art and as forms that inscribe a sense of community: the surface
      of ‘depicted’ signs, the split reality of the theatre, the rhythm of a
      dancing chorus. These forms define the way in which works of art or
      performances are ‘involved in politics’, whatever may otherwise be the
      guiding intentions, artists’ social modes of integration, or the manner
      in which artistic forms reflect social structures or movements. When
      Madame Bovary was published, or Sentimental Education, these works
      were immediately perceived as ‘democracy in literature’ despite Flaubert’s
      aristocratic situation and political conformism. His very refusal to
      entrust literature with any message whatsoever was considered to be
      evidence of democratic equality. His adversaries claimed that he was [17]
      democratic due to his decision to depict and portray instead of instruct.
      This equality of indifference is the result of a poetic bias: the equality
      of all subject matter is the negation of any relationship of necessity
      between a determined form and a determined content. Yet what is this
      indifference after all if not the very equality of everything that comes to
      pass on a written page, available as it is to everyone’s eyes? This equality
      destroys all of the hierarchies of representation and also establishes a
      community of readers as a community without legitimacy, a community
      formed only by the random circulation of the written word.
      In this way, a sensible politicity exists that is immediately attributed
      to the major forms of aesthetic distribution such as the theatre, the page, or the chorus. These ‘politics’ obey their own proper logic, and
      they offer their services in very different contexts and time periods.
      Consider the way these paradigms functioned in the connection
      between art and politics at the end of the nineteenth century and the
      beginning of the twentieth. Consider, for example, the role taken on
      by the paradigm of the page in all its different forms, which exceed
      the materiality of a written sheet of paper. Novelistic democracy, on
      the one hand, is the indifferent democracy of writing such as [18] it is
      symbolized by the novel and its readership. There is also, however, the
      knowledge concerning typography and iconography, the intertwining
      of graphic and pictorial capabilities, that played such an important
      role in the Renaissance and was revived by Romantic typography
      through its use of vignettes, culs-de-lampe, and various innovations.
      This model disturbs the clear-cut rules of representative logic that
      establish a relationship of correspondence at a distance between the
      sayable and the visible. It also disturbs the clear partition between
      works of pure art and the ornaments made by the decorative arts.
      This is why it played such an important - and generally underesti
      mated - role in the upheaval of the representative paradigm and of its
      political implications. I am thinking in particular of its role in the Arts
      and Crafts movement and all of its derivatives (Art Deco, Bauhaus,
      Constructivism). These movements developed an idea of furniture - in
      the broad sense of the term - for a new community, which also inspired
      a new idea of pictorial surface as a surface of shared writing.
      Modernist discourse presents the revolution of pictorial abstraction
      as painting’s discovery of its own proper medium’: two-dimensional
      surface. By revoking the perspectivist illusion of the third dimension,
      painting was to regain [19] the mastery of its own proper surface. In
      actual fact, however, this surface does not have any distinctive feature.
      A ‘surface’ is not simply a geometric composition of lines. It is a certain
      distribution of the sensible. For Plato, writing and painting were equiv
      alent surfaces of mute signs, deprived of the breath that animates and
      transports living speech. Flat surfaces, in this logic, are not opposed
      to depth in the sense of three-dimensional surfaces. They are opposed
      to the ‘living’. The mute surface of depicted signs stands in opposition
      to the act of ‘living’ speech, which is guided by the speaker towards
      its appropriate addressee. Moreover, painting’s adoption of the third dimension was also a response to this distribution. The reproduction
      of optical depth was linked to the privilege accorded to the story. In the
      Renaissance, the reproduction of three-dimensional space was involved
      in the valorization of painting and the assertion of its ability to capture
      an act of living speech, the decisive moment of action and meaning. In
      opposition to the Platonic degradation of mimesis, the classical poetics
      of representation wanted to endow the ‘flat surface’ with speech or with
      a ‘scene’ of life, with a specific depth such as the manifestation of an
      action, the expression of an interiority, or the transmission of meaning.
      Classical poetics established [20] a relationship of correspondence at
      a distance between speech and painting, between the sayable and the
      visible, which gave ‘imitation’ its own specific space.
      It is this relationship that is at stake in the supposed distinction
      between two-dimensional and three-dimensional space as ‘specific’
      to a particular form of art. To a large extent, the ground was laid for
      painting’s ‘anti-representative revolution’ by the flat surface of the
      page, in the change in how literature’s ‘images’ function or the change
      in the discourse on painting, but also in the ways in which typog
      raphy, posters, and the decorative arts became interlaced. The type
      of painting that is poorly named abstract, and which is supposedly
      brought back to its own proper medium, is implicated in an overall
      vision of a new human being lodged in new structures, surrounded by
      different objects. Its flatness is linked to the flatness of pages, posters,
      and tapestries. It is the flatness of an interface. Moreover, its anti-repre-
      sentative ‘purity’ is inscribed in a context where pure art and decorative
      art are intertwined, a context that straight away gives it a political
      signification. This context is not the surrounding revolutionary fever
      that made Malevich at once the artist who painted Black Square and
      the revolutionary eulogist of [21] ‘new forms of life’. Furthermore,
      this is not some theatrical ideal of the new human being that seals
      the momentary alliance between revolutionary artists and politics.
      It is initially in the interface created between different ‘mediums’
      - in the connections forged between poems and their typography or
      their illustrations, between the theatre and its set designers or poster
      designers, between decorative objects and poems - that this ‘newness’
      is formed that links the artist who abolishes figurative representation
      to the revolutionary who invents a new form of life. This interface is political in that it revokes the twofold politics inherent in the logic
      of representation. On the one hand, this logic separated the world
      of artistic imitations from the world of vital concerns and politico-
      social grandeur. On the other hand, its hierarchical organization - in
      particular the primacy of living speech/action over depicted images -
      formed an analogy with the socio-political order. With the triumph of
      the novels page over the theatrical stage, the egalitarian intertwining
      of images and signs on pictorial or typographic surfaces, the elevation
      of artisans’ art to the status of great art, and the new claim to bring art
      into the décor of each and every life, an entire well-ordered distribution
      of sensory experience was overturned.
      [22] This is how the ‘planarity’ of the surface of depicted signs, the
      form of egalitarian distribution of the sensible stigmatized by Plato,
      intervened as the principle behind an art’s ‘formal’ revolution at the
      same time as the principle behind the political redistribution of shared
      experience. The other major forms, among which there are those of the
      chorus and the theatre that I mentioned earlier, could be considered in
      much the same way. A history of aesthetic politics, understood in this
      sense, has to take into account the way in which these major forms
      stand in opposition to one another or intermingle. I am thinking,
      for example, of the way in which this paradigm of the surface of
      signs/forms entered into conflict or joined forces with the theatrical
      paradigm of presence, and with the diverse forms that this paradigm
      itself has taken on, from the Symbolist figuration of a collective legend
      to the actualized chorus of a new humanity. Politics plays itself out
      in the theatrical paradigm as the relationship between the stage and
      the audience, as meaning produced by the actor’s body, as games of
      proximity or distance. Mallarmé’s critical prose writings stage, in an
      exemplary manner, the play of cross-references, oppositions or assimi
      lations between these forms, from the intimate theatre of the page or
      calligraphic choreography to the new ‘service’ performed by concerts.
      [23] In one respect, these forms therefore appear to bring forth,
      in very different contexts, figures of community equal to themselves.
      However, they are susceptible to being assigned to contradictory political
      paradigms. Let us take the example of the tragic stage. It simultan
      eously carries with it, according to Plato, the syndrome of democracy
      and the power of illusion. By isolating mimesis in its own proper space and by enclosing tragedy within a logic of genres, Aristotle - even if
      this was not his intention - redefined its politicity. Furthermore, in
      the classical system of representation, the tragic stage would become
      the stage of visibility for an orderly world governed by a hierarchy
      of subject matter and the adaptation of situations and manners of
      speaking to this hierarchy. The democratic paradigm would become a
      monarchical paradigm. Let us also consider the long and contradictory
      history of rhetoric and the model of the £good orator. Throughout the
      monarchical age, democratic eloquence à la Demosthenes denoted an
      excellence in speaking, which was itself established as the imaginary
      attribute of the supreme power. It was also always receptive, however,
      to the recovery of its democratic function by lending its [24] canonical
      forms and its consecrated images to the transgressive appearance of
      unauthorized speakers on the public stage. Let us consider as well the
      contradictory destinies of the choreographic model. Recent research
      has evoked the metamorphoses undergone by Labans notation of
      movement. It was developed in a context favouring the liberation
      of bodies and became the model for the large Nazi demonstrations
      before regaining, in the anti-establishment context of performance
      art, a new subversive virginity. Benjamins explanation via the fatal
      aestheticization of politics in the era of the masses’ overlooks, perhaps,
      the long-standing connection between the unanimous consensus of
      the citizenry and the exaltation of the free movement of bodies. In
      a city hostile to the theatre and to written law, Plato recommended
      constantly cradling unweaned infants.
      I have evoked these three forms because Plato conceptually charted
      them out and because they maintain a historical constancy. They
      obviously do not define all of the ways that figures of community
      are aesthetically designed. The important thing is that the question
      of the relationship between aesthetics and politics be raised at this
      level, the level of the sensible delimitation of what is common to
      the community, the forms of its visibility and of its organization.
      [25] It is from this perspective that it is possible to reflect on artists’
      political interventions, starting with the Romantic literary forms that
      aimed at deciphering society, the Symbolist poetics of dreams or the
      Dadaist or Constructivist elimination of art, and continuing up to
      the contemporary modes of performance and installation. From this perspective, it is possible to challenge a good many imaginary stories
      about artistic ‘modernity’ and vain debates over the autonomy of art
      or its submission to politics. The arts only ever lend to projects of
      domination or emancipation what they are able to lend to them, that
      is to say, quite simply, what they have in common with them: bodily
      positions and movements, functions of speech, the parcelling out of the
      visible and the invisible. Furthermore, the autonomy they can enjoy or
      the subversion they can claim credit for rest on the same foundation.
      Certain o f the most fu ndam ental categories used fo r thinking about artistic
creation in the twentieth century, namely the categories o f modernity, the
avant-garde and, fo r some time now, postm odernity, also happen to have
a political m eaning Do these categories seem to you to have the slightest
interest fo r conceiving, in precise terms, what ties ‘aesthetics’ to ‘politics’?
I do not think that the notions of modernity and the avant-garde have
been very enlightening when it comes to thinking about the new forms
of art that have emerged since the last century or the relations between
aesthetics and politics. They actually confuse two very different
things: the historicity specific to a regime of the arts in general and
the decisions to break with the past or anticipate the future that take
place within this regime. The notion of aesthetic modernity conceals -
without conceptualizing it in the least - the singularity of a particular
regime of the arts, that is [27] to say of a specific type of connection
between ways of producing works of art or developing practices, forms
of visibility that disclose them, and ways of conceptualizing the former
and the latter.
A detour is necessary here in order to clarify this notion and situate
the problem. With regard to what we call art, it is in fact possible
to distinguish, within the Western tradition, three major regimes of
identification. There is first of all what I propose to call an ethical
regime of images. In this regime, art’ is not identified as such but is
subsumed under the question of images. As a specific type of entity,
images are the object of a twofold question: the question of their origin
(and consequently their truth content) and the question of their end
or purpose, the uses they are put to and the effects they result in. The
question of images of the divine and the right to produce such images
or the ban placed on them falls within this regime, as well as the
question of the status and signification of the images produced. The
entire Platonic polemic against the simulacra of painting, poems, and
the stage also falls within this regime.6 Plato does not, as it is often
claimed, place art under the yoke of politics. This very distinction
would have made no sense for Plato since art did not exist for [28] him
but only arts, ways of doing and making. And it is among these that
he traces the dividing line: there are true arts, that is to say forms of
knowledge based on the imitation of a model with precise ends, and
artistic simulacra that imitate simple appearances. These imitations,
differentiated by their origin, are then distinguished by their end or
purpose, by the way in which the poem’s images provide the spectators,
both children and adult citizens, with a certain education and fit in
with the distribution of the city’s occupations. It is in this sense that
I speak of an ethical regime of images. In this regime, it is a matter
of knowing in what way images’ mode of being affects the ethos, the
mode of being of individuals and communities. This question prevents
art’ from individualizing itself as such.7
The poetic - or representative - regime of the arts breaks away from
the ethical regime of images. It identifies the substance of art - or
rather of the arts - in the couple poieis!m im esis. The mimetic principle
is not at its core a normative principle stating that art must make
copies resembling their models. It is first of all a pragmatic principle
that isolates, within the general domain of the arts (ways of doing and
making), certain particular forms of art that produce specific entities
[29] called imitations. These imitations are extricated, at one and the
same time, from the ordinary control of artistic products by their use
and from the legislative reign of truth over discourses and images.
Such is the vast operation carried out by the Aristotelian elaboration of
m im esisz n à b y the privilege accorded to tragic action. It is the substance
of the poem, the fabrication of a plot arranging actions that represent
the activities of men, which is the foremost issue, to the detriment of
the essence of the image, a copy examined with regard to its model. Such
is the principle guiding the functional change in the theatrical model
I was speaking of earlier. The principle regulating the external delimi
tation of a well-founded domain of imitations is thus at the same time
a normative principle of inclusion. It develops into forms of norma-
tivity that define the conditions according to which imitations can be
recognized as exclusively belonging to an art and assessed, within this
framework, as good or bad, adequate or inadequate: partitions between
the representable and the unrepresentable; the distinction between
genres according to what is represented; principles for adapting forms
of expression to genres and thus to the subject matter represented; the
distribution of resemblances [30] according to principles of verisimil
itude, appropriateness, or correspondence; criteria for distinguishing
between and comparing the arts; etc.
I call this regime p oetic in the sense that it identifies the arts - what
the Classical Age would later call the ‘fine arts’ - within a classification
of ways of doing and making, and it consequently defines proper ways
of doing and making as well as means of assessing imitations. I call
it representative insofar as it is the notion of representation or mimesis
that organizes these ways of doing, making, seeing, and judging. Once
again, however, mimesis is not the law that brings the arts under the
yoke of resemblance. It is first of all a fold in the distribution of ways of
doing and making as well as in social occupations, a fold that renders
the arts visible. It is not an artistic process but a regime of visibility
regarding the arts. A regime of visibility is at once what renders the
arts autonomous and also what links this autonomy to a general order
of occupations and ways of doing and making. This is what I evoked
earlier concerning the logic of representation, which enters into a
relationship of global analogy with an overall hierarchy of political
and social occupations. The representative primacy of action over
characters or of narration over [31] description, the hierarchy of genres
according to the dignity of their subject matter, and the very primacy
of the art of speaking, of speech in actuality, all of these elements figure
into an analogy with a fully hierarchical vision of the community.
The aesthetic regime of the arts stands in contrast with the repre
sentative regime. I call this regime aesthetic because the identification
of art no longer occurs via a division within ways of doing and making,
but it is based on distinguishing a sensible mode of being specific to
artistic products. The word aesthetics does not refer to a theory of
sensibility, taste, and pleasure for art amateurs. It strictly refers to the
specific mode of being of whatever falls within the domain of art, to
the mode of being of the objects of art. In the aesthetic regime, artistic
phenomena are identified by their adherence to a specific regime of
the sensible, which is extricated from its ordinary connections and is
inhabited by a heterogeneous power, the power of a form of thought
that has become foreign to itself: a product identical with something
not produced, knowledge transformed into non-knowledge, logos
identical with pathos, the intention of the unintentional, etc. This idea
of a regime of the sensible that has become foreign to itself, the locus
for a form of thought that has become foreign to itself, is the invariable
core in the [32] identifications of art that have configured the aesthetic
mode of thought from the outset: Vico’s discovery of the ‘true Homer’
as a poet in spite of himself, Kantian genius’ that is unaware of the law
it produces, Schiller’s ‘aesthetic state’ that suspends both the activity of
the understanding and sensible passivity, Schelling’s definition of art as
the identity between a conscious process and an unconscious process,
etc. The aesthetic mode of thought likewise runs through the specific
definitions that the arts have given to themselves in the Modern Age:
Proust’s idea of a book that would be entirely planned out and fully
removed from the realm of the will; Mallarmé’s idea of a poem by the
spectator-poet, written ‘without the scribe’s apparatus’ by the steps
of an illiterate dancer; the Surrealist practice of producing work that
expresses the artist’s unconscious with the outdated illustrations in
catalogues or newspaper serials from the previous century; Bresson’s
idea of film as the film-maker’s thought withdrawn from the body of
the ‘models’ who, by unthinkingly repeating the words and gestures
he lays down for them, manifest their proper truth without either the
film-maker or the models knowing it; etc.
It is pointless to go on with definitions and examples. We need
to indicate, on the contrary, the heart of the problem. The aesthetic
regime [33] of the arts is the regime that strictly identifies art in the
singular and frees it from any specific rule, from any hierarchy of
the arts, subject matter, and genres. Yet it does so by destroying the
mimetic barrier that distinguished ways of doing and making affiliated
with art from other ways of doing and making, a barrier that separated
its rules from the order of social occupations. The aesthetic regime
asserts the absolute singularity of art and, at the same time, destroys
any pragmatic criterion for isolating this singularity. It simultaneously
establishes the autonomy of art and the identity of its forms with the
forms that life uses to shape itself. Schiller’s aesthetic state, which is this
regimes first manifesto (and remains, in a sense, unsurpassable), clearly
indicates this fundamental identity of opposites. The aesthetic state is
a pure instance of suspension, a moment when form is experienced for
itself. Moreover, it is the moment of the formation and education of a
specific type of humanity.
From this perspective, it is possible to understand the functions
served by the notion of modernity. The aesthetic regime of the arts, it
can be said, is the true name for what is designated by the incoherent
label ‘modernity’. However, ‘modernity’ is more than an incoherent
label. It is, in its different versions, the concept that diligently works
at [34] masking the specificity of this regime of the arts and the very
meaning of the specificity of regimes of art. It traces, in order either
to exalt or deplore it, a simple line of transition or rupture between
the old and the new, the representative and the non-representative or
the anti-representative. The basis for this simplistic historical account
was the transition to non-figurative representation in painting. This
transition was theorized by being cursorily assimilated into artistic
‘modernity’s’ overall anti-mimetic destiny. When the eulogists of this
form of modernity saw the exhibition-spaces for the well-behaved
destiny of modernity invaded by all kinds of objects, machines, and
unidentified devices, they began denouncing the ‘tradition of the new’,
a desire for innovation that would reduce artistic modernity to the
emptiness of its self-declaration. However, it is the starting point that
is erroneous. The leap outside of mimesis is by no means the refusal of
figurative representation. Furthermore, its inaugural moment has often
been called realism, which does not in any way mean the valorization
of resemblance but rather the destruction of the structures within
which it functioned. Thus, novelistic realism is first of all the reversal
of the hierarchies of representation (the primacy of the narrative over
the descriptive [35] or the hierarchy of subject matter) and the adoption
of a fragmented or proximate mode of focalization, which imposes raw
presence to the detriment of the rational sequences of the story. The
aesthetic regime of the arts does not contrast the old with the new. It
contrasts, more profoundly, two regimes of historicity. It is within the
mimetic regime that the old stands in contrast with the new. In the
aesthetic regime of art, the future of art, its separation from the present
of non-art, incessantly restages the past.
Those who exalt or denounce the ‘tradition of the new’ actually
forget that this tradition has as its strict complement the newness
of the tradition. The aesthetic regime of the arts did not begin with
decisions to initiate an artistic rupture. It began with decisions to
reinterpret what makes art or what art makes: Vico discovering the
‘true Homer, that is to say not an inventor of fables and characters but
a witness to the image-laden language and thought of ancient times;
Hegel indicating the true subject matter of Dutch genre painting: not
in stories or descriptions of interiors but a nations freedom displayed in
reflections of light; Hölderlin reinventing Greek tragedy; Balzac [36]
contrasting the poetry of the geologist who reconstructs worlds out
of tracks and fossils with the poetry that makes do with reproducing
a bit of agitation in the soul; Mendelssohn replaying the St. M atthew
Passion\ etc. The aesthetic regime of the arts is first of all a new regime
for relating to the past. It actually sets up as the very principle of
artisticity the expressive relationship inherent in a time and a state
of civilization, a relationship that was previously considered to be the
‘non-artistic’ part of works of art (the part that was excused by invoking
the crudeness of the times when the author lived). The aesthetic regime
of the arts invents its revolutions on the basis of the same idea that
caused it to invent the museum and art history, the notion of classicism
and new forms of reproduction... And it devotes itself to the invention
of new forms of life on the basis of an idea of what art was, an idea of
what art w ould have been. When the Futurists or the Constructivists
declared the end of art and the identification of its practices with the
practices that construct, decorate, or give a certain rhythm to the times
and spaces of communal life, they proposed an end of art equivalent to
the identification of art with the life of the community. This proposal
is directly dependent on the Schillerian and Romantic reinterpretation
of Greek art as a community’s mode of life, while also communicating,
[37] in other respects, with the new styles introduced by the inventors
of advertising who, for their part, did not propose a revolution but
only a new way of living amongst words, images, and commodities.
The idea of modernity is a questionable notion that tries to make clear-
cut distinctions in the complex configuration of the aesthetic regime
of the arts. It tries to retain the forms of rupture, the iconoclastic
gestures, etc., by separating them from the context that allows for their existence: history, interpretation, patrimony, the museum, the perva
siveness of reproduction... The idea of modernity would like there to
be only one meaning and direction in history, whereas the temporality
specific to the aesthetic regime of the arts is a co-presence of heteroge
neous temporalities.
The notion of modernity thus seems to have been deliberately
invented to prevent a clear understanding of the transformations of
art and its relationships with the other spheres of collective experience.
The confusion introduced by this notion has, it seems to me, two
major forms. Both of them, without analysing it, rely on the contra
diction constitutive of the aesthetic regime of the arts, which makes art
into an autonomous form o f life and thereby sets down, at one and the
same time, the autonomy of art and its identification with a moment
in life’s process of self-formation. The two [38] major variants of the
discourse on ‘modernity’ derive from this contradiction. The first
variant would have modernity identified simply with the autonomy
of art, an ‘anti-mimetic’ revolution in art identical with the conquest
of the pure form of art finally laid bare. Each individual art would
thus assert the pure potential of art by exploring the capabilities of
its specific medium. Poetic or literary modernity would explore the
capabilities of a language diverted from its communicational uses.
Pictorial modernity would bring painting back to its distinctive feature:
coloured pigment and a two-dimensional surface. Musical modernity
would be identified with the language of twelve sounds, set free from
any analogy with expressive language, etc. Furthermore, these specific
forms of modernity would be in a relationship of distant analogy with
a political modernity susceptible to being identified, depending on the
time period, with revolutionary radicality or with the sober and disen
chanted modernity of good republican government. The main feature
of what is called the ‘crisis of art’ is the overwhelming defeat of this
simple modernist paradigm, which is forever more distant from the
mixtures of genres and mediums as well as from the numerous political
possibilities inherent in the arts’ contemporary forms. [39]
This overwhelming defeat is obviously overdetermined by the
modernist paradigm’s second major form, which might be called
modernatism. I mean by this the identification of forms from the
aesthetic regime of the arts with forms that accomplish a task or fulfil
a destiny specific to modernity. At the root of this identification there
is a specific interpretation of the structural and generative contra
diction of aesthetic ‘form’. It is, in this case, the determination of
art qua form and self-formation of life that is valorized. The starting
point, Schillers notion of the aesthetic education o f man, constitutes
an unsurpassable reference point. It is this notion that established the
idea that domination and servitude are, in the first place, part of an
ontological distribution (the activity of thought versus the passivity of
sensible matter). It is also this notion that defined a neutral state, a state
of dual cancellation, where the activity of thought and sensible recep
tivity become a single reality. They constitute a sort of new region of
being - the region of free play and appearance - that makes it possible
to conceive of the equality whose direct materialization, according to
Schiller, was shown to be impossible by the French Revolution. It is this
specific mode of living in the sensible world that must be developed by
‘aesthetic education [40] in order to train men susceptible to live in
a free political community. The idea of modernity as a time devoted
to the material realization of a humanity still latent in mankind
was constructed on this foundation. It can be said, regarding this
point, that the ‘aesthetic revolution produced a new idea of political
revolution: the material realization of a common humanity still only
existing as an idea. This is how Schillers ‘aesthetic state’ became
the ‘aesthetic programme’ of German Romanticism, the programme
summarized in the rough draft written together by Hegel, Hölderlin,
and Schelling: the material realization of unconditional freedom and
pure thought in common forms of life and belief. It is this paradigm of
aesthetic autonomy that became the new paradigm for revolution, and
it subsequently allowed for the brief but decisive encounter between
the artisans of the Marxist revolution and the artisans of forms for a
new way of life. The failure of this revolution determined the destiny
- in two phases - of modernatism. At first, artistic modernatism, in
its authentic revolutionary potential for [41] hope and defiance, was
set against the degeneration of political revolution. Surrealism and
the Frankfurt School were the principal vehicles for this counter
modernity. The failure of political revolution was later conceived of as
the failure of its ontologico-aesthetic model. Modernity thus became
something like a fatal destiny based on a fundamental forgetting:
the essence of technology according to Heidegger, the revolutionary
severing of the kings head as a severing of tradition in the history of
humanity, and finally the original sin of human beings, forgetful of
their debt to the Other and of their submission to the heterogeneous
powers of the sensible.
What is called postmodernism is really the process of this reversal. At
first, postmodernism brought to light everything in the recent evolution
of the arts and possible ways of thinking the arts that destroyed modern
ism’s theoretical edifice: the crossing-over and mixture between the
arts that destroyed Lessings conventional set of principles concerning
the separation of the arts; the collapse of the paradigm of functionalist
architecture and the return of the curved line and embellishment; the
breakdown of the pictorial/two-dimensional/abstract model through
the return of figurative representation and [42] signification as well as
the slow invasion of paintings exhibition-space by three-dimensional
and narrative forms, from Pop Art to installation art and ‘rooms’ for
video art;8 the new combinations of painting and language as well as
of monumental sculpture and the projection of shadows and lights; the
break-up of the serial tradition through new mixtures between musical
systems, genres, and epochs. The teleological model of modernity
became untenable at the same time as its divisions between the
‘distinctive features’ of the different arts, or the separation of a pure
domain of art. Postmodernism, in a sense, was simply the name under
whose guise certain artists and thinkers realized what modernism had
been: a desperate attempt to establish a ‘distinctive feature of art’ by
linking it to a simple teleology of historical evolution and rupture.
There was not really a need, moreover, to make this late recognition
of a fundamental fact of the aesthetic regime of the arts into an actual
temporal break, the real end of a historical period.
However, it was precisely the next episode that showed that postmod
ernism was more than this. The joyful, postmodern artistic license, its
[43] exaltation of the carnival of simulacra, all sorts of interbreeding
and hybridization, transformed very quickly and came to challenge
the freedom or autonomy that the modernatist principle conferred - or
would have conferred - upon art the mission of accomplishing. There
was thus a return from the carnival to the primal scene. However, the
primal scene can be taken in two senses, either as the starting point of a
process or as an original separation. Modernist faith had latched on to
the idea of the ‘aesthetic education of man’ that Schiller had extracted
from the Kantian analytic of the beautiful. The postmodern reversal
had as its theoretical foundation Lyotard’s analysis of the Kantian
sublime, which was reinterpreted as the scene of a founding distance
separating the idea from any sensible presentation. From this moment
onward, postmodernism came into harmony with the mourning and
repenting of modernatist thought, and the scene of sublime distance
came to epitomize all sorts of scenes of original distance or original
sin: the Heideggerian flight of the gods, the irreducible aspect of
the unsymbolizable object and the death drive as analysed by Freud,
the voice of the Absolutely Other declaring a ban on representation,
the revolutionary murder of the Father. Postmodernism thus became
the grand threnody of the unrepresentable/intractable [44] /irredeemable,
denouncing the modern madness of the idea of a self-emancipation of
mankinds humanity and its inevitable and interminable culmination
in the death camps.
The notion of the avant-garde defines the type of subject suitable
to the modernist vision and appropriate, according to this vision,
for connecting the aesthetic to the political. Its success is due less to
the convenient connection it proposes between the artistic idea of
innovation and the idea of politically-guided change, than to the more
covert connection it establishes between two ideas of the avant-garde’.
On the one hand, there is the topographical and military notion of the
force that marches in the lead, that has a clear understanding of the
movement, embodies its forces, determines the direction of historical
evolution, and chooses subjective political orientations.9 In short, there
is the idea that links political subjectivity to a certain form: the party,
an advanced detachment that derives its ability to lead from its ability
to read and interpret the signs of history. On the other hand, there
is another idea of the avant-garde that, in accordance with Schiller’s
model, is rooted in the aesthetic anticipation of the future. If the
concept of the avant-garde has any meaning in the aesthetic regime of
the arts, it is on this side of things, not on the side of the [45] advanced
detachments of artistic innovation but on the side of the invention of
sensible forms and material structures for a life to come. This is what
the ‘aesthetic’ avant-garde brought to the ‘political’ avant-garde, or
what it wanted to bring to it - and what it believed to have brought to
it - by transforming politics into a total life programme. The history of
the relations between political parties and aesthetic movements is first
of all the history of a confusion, sometimes complacently maintained,,
at other times violently denounced, between these two ideas of the
avant-garde, which are in fact two different ideas of political subjec
tivity: the archi-political idea of a party, that is to say the idea of a
form of political intelligence that sums up the essential conditions for
change, and the meta-political idea of global political subjectivity, the
idea of the potentiality inherent in the innovative sensible modes of
experience that anticipate a community to come. There is, however,
nothing accidental about this confusion. It is not the case, as today’s
doxa would have us believe, that artists’ ambitious claims to a total
revolution of the sensible paved the way for totalitarianism. It is rather
that the very idea of a political avant-garde is divided between the
strategic conception and the aesthetic conception of the avant-garde.
