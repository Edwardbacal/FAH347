          Futurism is essentially an acceleration of successive images, seen simultaneously, across a very shallow plain, as also was the 'cubo-futurism' of Marcel Duchamp's Nude Descending a Staircase. What Vorticism did was to extend this acceleration into depth, creating an intense, inrushing perspective - a vortex.

              At first glance Composition presents a compressed series of mechanical forms and abstract references to the modern city. However, it is possible to recognise traces of human figures. Dynamic thrusting shapes rise from the lower left but are contained within a claustrophobic, abstract environment. These forms can be seen as a dancing couple. The woman, on the right, bends backwards. The white parallelogram halfway up the right edge is perhaps her hair. The pleated curving architectural form at the bottom centre could be her skirt.

              Lewis had a particular interest in the modern city as a place of tensions. In this work two slanting forms resemble architectural structures. Their steep diagonal focus dominates the composition. However, like other works by Lewis from this period, the drawing communicates a strong feeling of instability, arrested motion and agitation. These abstracted urban forms are also suggestive of figures, perhaps caught in a lull in between actions.

              The subject of this painting is the hold of a ship, in which dock workers are handling heavy freight. However, Bomberg has divided the canvas into a grid of squares that are themselves divided. The effect of this is to shatter form, transforming the scene into a kinetic pattern of shape and dazzling colour. Though the image has become hard to decipher, the fragmented composition expresses the energy of men at work in an industrial environment.

              Bathing figures were a traditional way of depicting the nude, but here Bomberg brings the subject into the modern era by basing the scene on steam baths used by the local Jewish population near Bombergâ€™s home in east London. Bomberg was closely associated with a group of artists known as the vorticists. Their aim was to create art that expressed the modern world through imagery derived from machines and the urban environment. Here Bomberg reduces the human figure to a series of geometric shapes, a process he described as 'searching for an intenser expression â€¦ where I use Naturalistic Form I have stripped it of all irrelevant matter.'

              Very little of Wadsworthâ€™s early work survives. He made this gouache in woodland near Lewes in Sussex, when he was twenty-four. He was exploring ideas about the depiction of form and space derived from CÃ©zanne and Cubism. Wadsworth rarely produced pastoral landscapes like this; his later work was to be dominated by industrial, urban and maritime imagery.

              Sharp diagonal lines converge towards a focal point. This painting recalls the poet Ezra Poundâ€™s description of the vortex as â€˜absorbing all that is around it in a violent whirlingâ€™. The vorticist groupâ€™s aggressive rhetoric, angular style and focus on the energy of modern life were similar to Italian futurism. However, they did not share the futuristsâ€™ emphasis on speed, or their romanticisation of technology. Wadsworth and the other vorticists had a more matter-of-fact attitude to the machine age. Their images betray little sense of celebratory excitement.

          This brutal energy was characteristic of Vorticism. At their best the Vorticists achieved a strong visualization of the headlong flight of Europe into mechanical barbarity, an awareness of the brutalization of man by his irresponsible control of his environment that is lacking in the idealized art of Cubism and the romanticized art of
          Futurism. This, and the acceleration of forms into depth, was the significant contribution of Vorticism to the art of the twentieth century.

    <h2>
      Precisionism
    </h2>
    
    <p>
      The Precisionists represented modern icons, but were these artists modernist? They never broached pure abstraction; on the contrary, they used its simplifications to represent the world all the more precisely. It was for this reason that Precisionism was sometimes called "Cubist Realism." "!twas Sheeler," [Gallerist, Marius] de Zayas remarked... "who proved that Cubism exists in nature and that photography can record it," and that painting based on photography, as often with Sheeler, might do so as well.
    </p>
    <cite>
      Art Since 1900, 235
    </cite>
    
    <p>
      Such art spiritualizes, monumentalizes, and naturalizes a historical moment as a machine age: New York as glorious cathedral, grain elevators as Egyptian pyramids, a factory as a classical landscape.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The Precisionists attempted to do so through a monumental style that combined a precision associated with photography with an abstraction derived from Cubism-ingredients that chastened and transformed one another. For example, the "Cubism" of Demuth and Sheeler is not "analytical" in the sense that the object is not fragmented. On the contrary, the planar projections of the ship vents in Upper Deck by Sheeler and the grain elevators in My Egypt by Demuth [ 3 l solidify the object, simplify its structure, and define its contour, and so clarify rather than complicate our vision. At the same time, these images are hardly photographic. Forms are reduced and spaces flattened, shadows emboldened and tonalities transformed-more so in Demuth, who is more lyrical than Sheeler. Architecture, then, is not only a prime motif of this art; it also influenced its way of seeing.
