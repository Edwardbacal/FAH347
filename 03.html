On the other hand, almost nothing of the subject, scale, colour, form or mood of this painting - nothing of its ambition - survives into Picasso's Cubism proper. Les Demoiselles d'Avignon is not so much the first Cubist painting, then, as the traumatic rupture that enables Cubism to begin."

        "You see, the whole Renaissance tradition is antipathetic to me. The hard-and-fast rules of perspective which it succeeded in imposing on art were a ghastly mistake which it has taken four centuries to redress: Cézanne and, after him, Picasso and myself can take a lot of credit for
        this. Sceintific perspective is nothing but fooling illusionism; it is simply a trick - a bad trick - which makes it impossible for an artist to convey a full experience of space, since it forces the objects in a picture to disappear away from the beholder instead of bringing them within his reach, as painting should."

            Pushing the tree over to the left of the house, Braque made the relationships between the walls and the roof more conspicuous. He applied an inconsistent chiaroscuro (modelling with light and dark tones), in which the light seems to fall now from the right, now from the left. At the same time, the shapes formed on the picture surface by the overlapping of objects in the represented space are made to relate to each other: the foliage at bottom right, for example, forms itself into a strange ridge that tries to link up with the eaves of the house above it. Finally, Braque inserts an area of house colour into the cleft in the tree to top left where, as is evident in the photograph, there should be foliage. Whereas Cezanne sought to capture depth and surface at the same time by representing the world in a logic of colours, Braque, reducing his palette to a crude code, has perhaps let the superficially odd effects of Cezanne's system overtake the logic. It could also be said that Braque has begun to abandon coherence of illusion - but what replaces it? The answer cannot be simply 'incoherence', since everything in the painting is obviously tightly controlled and balanced. The detached piece of'house' colour, or the contagious ridges, or the rhyming triangles, are like elements of the world set free to circulate in the painter's imagination.

        <h5>First off, what <em>is</em> Analytic Cubism</h5>
        <p>
          "Analytic Cubism (roughly 1908 to 1912) has come to refer to a process where three-dimensional objects are broken down into fragments - corresponding to their appearance from different viewpoints in space - which are then recombined in two-dimensions to produce a representation. Analytical Cubism supposedly proceeds from observed reality to art, and the near monochrome works by Braque and Picasso... especially from around 1910-11, are usually treated as classic examples of the method. Although Analytic Cubist painting rejects single-point perspective, its combination of multiple viewpoints is thought to offer a fuller version of perceived reality."

          1. a (progressive) dream of a new scientific era in which reality would be transformed philosophically;
        </p>
        <p>
          2. a (conservative) fantasy of a modern reinterpretation of the greatness of French classicism that would obliterate the artistic and cultural pretensions of all other nations and be expressed in all the arts; 
        </p>
        <p>
          3. a desire to claim for the artist absolute power to redefine art;
        </p>
        <p>
          and 4. a conflicting desire to demonstrate the absolute truth of Cubism

              The picture is thus fairly easy to decode: it represents an allegorical scene of pastoral fertility, an autumn harvest in which harmony exists between humanity and nature, and where an equation is drawn between cycles of natural production and the fertility of idealized womanhood. It is easy to find precedents for Abundance in the most tedious of academic paintings, and in Rococo-style decorative cycles based on the theme of the four seasons. Furthermore, the idea of a naive or Arcadian fertility was pervasive, not only in the official but in the avant-garde Salons around 1900. A woman in a landscape as an image of fertility carried a number of meanings. She was fundamentally natural rather than cultural, creative physically rather than mentally, and the close identification of her with nature meant that the tilled earth of France itself was to be equated with womanhood.
            </p>
            <p>
              ... Approaching Abundance with the benefit of a detailed exploration of Braque and Picasso's achievements of the previous years, it is clear that many of the representational devices that they had subjected to such scrutiny remained unquestioned by Le Fauconnier. Notwithstanding his pronouncements on mathematics, the painter has left the integrity of objects undisturbed, and the ample roundness of flesh and apples is reassuringly integrated and fixed in its proper place, bounded by descriptive lines and given careful local colouring. There is no difficulty in seeing the woman, boy and landscape, since the method adopted amounts to nothing more than a mannerism, and the results are hardly elegant. The area around the woman's hips and buttocks shows just how much trouble Le Fauconnier had in drawing this way.

        Theories of Cubism
      </h4>
      <div class="igBox">
        <p>
          The "conceptual" theory of Cubism, as a superior way of looking at the external world.
        </p>
        <p>
          For writers like Guillaume Apollinaire, Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinger (also cubist painters themselves), Andre Salmon, and Maurice Raynal, Cubism posits "the superiority of conceptual knowledge over merely perceptual realism." "Stating that natural vision is impoverished since we can never see the whole of a three-dimensional object from any single vantage point... they argued that Cubism overcomes this handicap by breaking with a single perspective to show the sides and back simultaneously with the front, so that we apprehend the thing from everywhere, grasping it conceptually as a composite of the views we would have if we actually moved around it."

      <div class="igBox">
        <p>
          The formalist view of Cubism, as an engagement with the internal space of the picture.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, "Cubism was exclusively concerned with bringing about the unity of the pictorial object... the necessary fusion of two seemingly irreconcilable opposites: the depicted volumes of "real" objects and the flatness of the painter's own physical object (just as "real" as anything in the world before the artist), which is the canvas plane of the picture."
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, the American critic Clement "Greenberg saw Analytical Cubism as the increasing fusion of two types of flatness: the "depicted flatness" by which the tilted planes shoved the fragmented objects closer and closer to the surface; and the "literal flatness" of that surface itself."

          André Salmon
        </h4>
        
        <p>
          Poet, novelist, and art critic. A very Parisian figure, Salmon is best remembered as an impresario and chronicler of the arts who did much to promote the 'vie d'artiste' in Montparnasse and the merits of artists such as Picasso and Modigliani who were among his familiars (see his Souvenirs sans fin, 3 vols., 1955–61). An eclectic and enthusiastic critic, he launched the review Le Festin d'Ésope with Apollinaire and Jacob in 1903. His intensely lyrical poetry, always tinged with nostalgia but often humorous and linguistically playful, is at its best in Créances (1926), Carreaux (1928), and Les Étoiles dans l'encrier (1952). Of his novels, the best is probably Le Manuscrit trouvé dans un chapeau (1919).

        <h4>
          Guillaume Apollinaire
        </h4>
        <p>
          French poet and art critic. Apollinaire was 'the most influential art critic writing in France during the decade before the outbreak of war in 1914…a cardinal figure in creating the artistic climate of Paris early in this century—a climate in which anything and everything was thought possible' (John Golding, Visions of the Modern, 1994). He earned his living mainly with journalism and was one of the prototypes of the modern critic, his writing containing much that is superficial and gossipy. His importance stems not so much from the quality of his writing as from his brilliance as a propagandist on behalf of those artists he most admired. In particular he championed Picasso (his first substantial articles, in 1905, were on him) and later the Cubists in general (including the Orphists, whose name he coined). Among the other artists whose reputations he either established or consolidated were Chagall, de Chirico, Derain, Matisse, and Henri Rousseau. He was also influential on Dada (his friend Marcel Duchamp's interest in visual punning was partly inspired by Apollinaire's love of jest and linguistic acrobatics) and on Surrealism (he coined the term in 1917 and his suggestion that artists should explore 'interior universes' stimulated André Breton, who dedicated the first Surrealist manifesto to his memory). Apollinaire was wounded in the head serving in the French army in 1916; weakened by this, he died of influenza two years later.

          Ambroise Vollard
        </h4>
        
        <p>
          French dealer, connoisseur, publisher, and writer, one of the most important champions of avant-garde art in the early 20th century. In 1893 he opened a gallery in Paris and in 1895 he gave the first important exhibition of Cézanne’s work. Other landmark events included the first one-man exhibitions of Picasso (1901) and Matisse (1904). His clientele included some of the leading collectors of the day, among them Albert C. Barnes and Gertrude and Leo Stein. As well as buying and selling paintings, Vollard played an important role as a publisher by encouraging his artists to work as printmakers. He commissioned them to illustrate books (literary classics as well as contemporary works) and also issued independent portfolios of prints, notably Picasso’s Vollard Suite, consisting of 100 etchings on various themes made between 1930 and 1937. His portrait was painted many times, among others by Bonnard, Cézanne, Picasso, Renoir, and Rouault. Vollard’s writings included books on Cézanne and Degas and the autobiographical Recollections of a Picture Dealer (1936); a slightly expanded French version, Souvenirs d’un marchand de tableaux, appeared in 1937.

        <p>
          German-born art dealer, publisher, and writer, who became a French citizen in 1937. In 1907 he opened a gallery in Paris. His first purchases were of Fauvist works, but he is best known as the friend and promoter of the Cubists. In 1912 Braque and Picasso signed contracts giving Kahnweiler exclusive rights to buy their entire outputs. He was also a friend and supporter of Juan Gris, of whom he wrote a standard biography (1947). As a publisher he brought out numerous books illustrated by his artist friends. In 1961 he published an autobiography, Mes galeries et mes peintres; in the introduction to the English translation, My Galleries and Painters (1971), John Russell wrote: ‘Where the old-style dealers did their artists a favour by inviting them to luncheon, Kahnweiler lived with Picasso, Braque, Gris, Derain, and Vlaminck on a day-to-day, hour-to-hour basis. The important thing was not so much that they should sell as that they should be free to get on with their work; and Kahnweiler, by making this possible, helped to bring into being what now seems to us that last great flowering of French art.’
