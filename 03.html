            "There is no doubt that the work marked a turning-point in Picasso's development, and that it provoked an extreme reaction in Braque, bringing the two artists into creative dialogue. On the other hand, almost nothing of the subject, scale, colour, form or mood of this painting - nothing of its ambition - survives into Picasso's Cubism proper. Les Demoiselles d'Avignon is not so much the first Cubist painting, then, as the traumatic rupture that enables Cubism to begin."

        "You see, the whole Renaissance tradition is antipathetic to me. The hard-and-fast rules of perspective which it succeeded in imposing on art were a ghastly mistake which it has taken four centuries to redress: Cézanne and, after him, Picasso and myself can take a lot of credit for
        this. Sceintific perspective is nothing but fooling illusionism; it is simply a trick - a bad trick - which makes it impossible for an artist to convey a full experience of space, since it forces the objects in a picture to disappear away from the beholder instead of bringing them within his reach, as painting should."

            Pushing the tree over to the left of the house, Braque made the relationships between the walls and the roof more conspicuous. He applied an inconsistent chiaroscuro (modelling with light and dark tones), in which the light seems to fall now from the right, now from the left. At the same time, the shapes formed on the picture surface by the overlapping of objects in the represented space are made to relate to each other: the foliage at bottom right, for example, forms itself into a strange ridge that tries to link up with the eaves of the house above it. Finally, Braque inserts an area of house colour into the cleft in the tree to top left where, as is evident in the photograph, there should be foliage. Whereas Cezanne sought to capture depth and surface at the same time by representing the world in a logic of colours, Braque, reducing his palette to a crude code, has perhaps let the superficially odd effects of Cezanne's system overtake the logic. It could also be said that Braque has begun to abandon coherence of illusion - but what replaces it? The answer cannot be simply 'incoherence', since everything in the painting is obviously tightly controlled and balanced. The detached piece of'house' colour, or the contagious ridges, or the rhyming triangles, are like elements of the world set free to circulate in the painter's imagination.

        <h5>First off, what <em>is</em> Analytic Cubism</h5>
        <p>
          "Analytic Cubism (roughly 1908 to 1912) has come to refer to a process where three-dimensional objects are broken down into fragments - corresponding to their appearance from different viewpoints in space - which are then recombined in two-dimensions to produce a representation. Analytical Cubism supposedly proceeds from observed reality to art, and the near monochrome works by Braque and Picasso... especially from around 1910-11, are usually treated as classic examples of the method. Although Analytic Cubist painting rejects single-point perspective, its combination of multiple viewpoints is thought to offer a fuller version of perceived reality."

              The picture is thus fairly easy to decode: it represents an allegorical scene of pastoral fertility, an autumn harvest in which harmony exists between humanity and nature, and where an equation is drawn between cycles of natural production and the fertility of idealized womanhood. It is easy to find precedents for Abundance in the most tedious of academic paintings, and in Rococo-style decorative cycles based on the theme of the four seasons. Furthermore, the idea of a naive or Arcadian fertility was pervasive, not only in the official but in the avant-garde Salons around 1900. A woman in a landscape as an image of fertility carried a number of meanings. She was fundamentally natural rather than cultural, creative physically rather than mentally, and the close identification of her with nature meant that the tilled earth of France itself was to be equated with womanhood.
            </p>
            <p>
              ... Approaching Abundance with the benefit of a detailed exploration of Braque and Picasso's achievements of the previous years, it is clear that many of the representational devices that they had subjected to such scrutiny remained unquestioned by Le Fauconnier. Notwithstanding his pronouncements on mathematics, the painter has left the integrity of objects undisturbed, and the ample roundness of flesh and apples is reassuringly integrated and fixed in its proper place, bounded by descriptive lines and given careful local colouring. There is no difficulty in seeing the woman, boy and landscape, since the method adopted amounts to nothing more than a mannerism, and the results are hardly elegant. The area around the woman's hips and buttocks shows just how much trouble Le Fauconnier had in drawing this way.

        Theories of Cubism

        <p>
          The "conceptual" theory of Cubism, as a superior way of looking at the external world.
        </p>
        <p>
          For writers like Guillaume Apollinaire, Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinger (also cubist painters themselves), Andre Salmon, and Maurice Raynal, Cubism posits "the superiority of conceptual knowledge over merely perceptual realism." "Stating that natural vision is impoverished since we can never see the whole of a three-dimensional object from any single vantage point... they argued that Cubism overcomes this handicap by breaking with a single perspective to show the sides and back simultaneously with the front, so that we apprehend the thing from everywhere, grasping it conceptually as a composite of the views we would have if we actually moved around it."

          The formalist view of Cubism, as an engagement with the internal space of the picture.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, "Cubism was exclusively concerned with bringing about the unity of the pictorial object... the necessary fusion of two seemingly irreconcilable opposites: the depicted volumes of "real" objects and the flatness of the painter's own physical object (just as "real" as anything in the world before the artist), which is the canvas plane of the picture."
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, the American critic Clement "Greenberg saw Analytical Cubism as the increasing fusion of two types of flatness: the "depicted flatness" by which the tilted planes shoved the fragmented objects closer and closer to the surface; and the "literal flatness" of that surface itself."

          Beaux Arts
        </h4>
        
        <p>
          A term applied to the style of classically inspired architecture, deriving from the teaching of the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, which laid emphasis on the architecture of antiquity and that of the Renaissance and 17th- and 18th-century France. It was particularly prevalent in the United States and France in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and was characterized by formal planning overlaid with rich detail that was often overemphasized or overscaled. Victor Laloux's Hôtel de Ville in Paris (1897–1904) and Warren & Wetmore's Grand Central Station in New York (1903–13) are good examples. The style can be found in Manhattan skyscrapers and town houses, Parisian blocks of flats, and British department stores. After 1918 the traditional Beaux-Arts style became obsolete and was superseded by the emerging modern movement.

        "impressionism" : `
        <h4>
          Impressionism
        </h4>
        <p>
          A movement in French painting, associated particularly with Monet, Pissarro, Sisley, Degas, and Renoir, characterized by the use of a bright palette, broken brushwork, and an emphasis on depictions of contemporary life and landscape. The term was originally coined as a form of satire by the critic Louis Leroy reviewing the first exhibition of the Société Anonyme des artistes, peintres, sculpteurs, graveurs…which opened on 15 April 1874, at the Parisian studio of the photographer Nadar on the boulevard des Capucines, and is nowadays referred to as the first Impressionist exhibition. Monet's painting Impression: Sunrise 1873 (Musée Marmottan, Paris) was singled out for particular attack, Leroy maintaining that the term ‘impression’ was too personal and should not have been used in a picture title (effet, i.e. an effect of nature, would have been preferable). In fact, ‘impression’ had a complex duality in 19th-century artistic theory, implying on the one hand the reception by the artist of the scene presented to him, on the other the subjective trace of the artist's own nature or temperament in the resulting work of art. The term ‘Impressionist’ rapidly went into widespread usage as a result of the 1874 exhibition and a further seven shows were staged, the last in 1886. There were a number of important contributory factors to the evolution of Impressionism: a growing interest in colour theory and the laws of complementary contrasts; an increasing liking, among landscape painters, for working en plein air; and a growing dissatisfaction with the official Salon exhibitions where many of the young Impressionists experienced frequent rejection. By the time of the final 1886 Impressionist exhibition, many of the participants had begun to experience considerable success, lauded by avant-garde critics and increasingly patronized by enlightened collectors. It was in the 1890s, however, that Impressionism really began to find its international market, especially in America (Britain by contrast was curiously slow to appreciate its merits). Paradoxically, it was also around this time that Impressionism began to be perceived, in certain right-wing religious circles in France, as the art of materialism, concerned only with the everyday. As a style it had become widespread, attracting a plethora of minor and repetitive adherents. Nevertheless, in the course of the 20th century Impressionism can fairly claim to have become the most widely popular of all movements with art lovers and collectors.

        <h4>
          Post-Impressionism
        </h4>
        
        <p>
          As the name implies, a term used to describe developments after and arising from Impressionism. It was first coined by the English painter and critic Roger Fry (1866–1934), who organized the exhibition Manet and the Post-Impressionists held at the Grafton Galleries, London in 1910–11. The imprecision of such an umbrella term, for all its undoubted usefulness, is demonstrated by the wide variety of developments from Impressionism: the quasi-scientific examination of colour by Seurat and the Neo-Impressionists; the structured examination of landscape by Cézanne in which lay the seeds of Cubism; the writhing, expressive brushwork of Van Gogh; the flat colour Symbolism of Gauguin and his followers.

        <h4>
          Fauvism
        </h4>
        
        <p>
          Derived from the French word fauve, 'wild beast', with which the critic Louis Vauxcelles described Matisse, Vlaminck, Derain, Rouault, and Marquet when he saw the flat patterns and strong colours of their works exhibited in 1905 in the Salon d'Automne in Paris, Fauvism briefly brought together these painters who were seeking, in the wake of Gauguin, Van Gogh, and Cézanne, to explore the expressive potential of colour. In its emphasis on the material, sensuous element of painting, it has been related to the emergence in literature of the poetic movement known as 'le naturisme', which in the closing years of the 19th c. played a major role in the reaction against Symbolism.
