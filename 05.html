      Whether from fear of becoming <em>just decorative</em> or of letting go of its semiotic anchors in the real world.

        Yve-Alain Bois summarizes the Cubism's influence on abstraction:
      </h5>
      <p>
        Cubism was the first style to perform this paradox of an art that appears both abstract and realist, and it remained the crucible for most abstract artists. Yet "Cubism did not accept the logical consequences of its own discoveries," Mondrian remarked in a retrospect shared by others, "it was not developing towards its own goals, the expression of pure plastics." Thus in 1912-13 some artists pushed the "analytical" aspect of Cubism to dissolve the motif altogether. They did so either in linear coordination with the implicit grid of the canvas, as with Mondrian... or through prismatic effects of color seen as light, as with Delaunay... If Mondrian explicated the grid in a way that exceeded the faceted planes of Cubism, Delaunay intensified color in a manner that was alien to its muted palette. Meanwhile, other artists pushed the "synthetic" aspect of Cubism: the flat shapes of Cubist collage were the immediate precedent for the abstract color  planes of Malevich, while the factual elements of Cubist construction, which Picasso showed Vladimir Tatlin in Paris in the spring of 1914, were one provocation of his Constructivist "analysis of materials." Some kind of passage through Cubism became almost a  prerequisite for followers: "From a [Cubist] analysis of the volume and space of objects to the [Constructivist] organization of elements," the Russian Liubov Popova (1889-1924) wrote in a 1922 studio note, as if this development were already a catechism.
      </p>
      <p>moreover...</p>
      
      <p>
        Even as abstraction moved away from a mimetic relation to the world it did not necessarily embrace the "arbitrary" nature of the sign as explored in Cubist collage and construction. Abstract artists might have declined to depict worldly things, but they often aspired to evoke transcendental concepts-such as "spirit," or "purity"-and in this way they replaced one type of grounding, one form of authority, with another.

        A name* appropriated from Symbolist theorists by Guillaume Apollinaire, and used to designate the work of Robert Delaunay, Marcel Duchamp, Fernand Léger, Francis Picabia and (to an extent) Pablo Picasso that revealed a tendency towards colour abstraction. Though hardly any of the artists accepted the label, Apollinaire argued that they shared a common interest in 'pure' painting, which would give a 'pure aesthetic pleasure'

      So what were Picasso and Braque up to?
    </h3>
    <p>
      The rise of abstract painting dovetailed with a return to <em>figuration</em>, whether by dialing down Cubism's visual ambiguity, instead emphasizing recognizable figures and themes, to a return to Classical style.

      Some context
    </h5>
    <p>
      The lead-up to World War I saw a dramatic rise in nationalism among Europe's big powers that coincided with a reactionary turn toward the "traditional" - nostalgic fantasies about of pre-lapsarian Classicism, often tinged with an air of racial purity 🤮
    </p>
    <p>  
      Cubism was already vilified in the popular press as being un-French, even too German. Meanwhile, the (actually) German gallerists and dealers who were instrumental in supporting Cubism's advancement (Daniel Henry-Kahnwiler, Ambroise Vollard, and Wilhelm Uhde) were deported and disenfranchised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Things didn't get better after the war: the death of many leading art figures, economic ruin, and the generalized trauma of war did little to nurture artistic experimentation among established artists.

    <div class="igBox"  style="margin: 20vh 0;">
      <h4>
        A return to order?
      </h4>
      <p>
        The <em>rappel à l'ordre</em> (return to order) issued a call for a return to the presumed classical roots of French art, in the course of which its proponents opened an attack on Cubism. The beginnings of this return are assigned various dates, a late one being the 1923 essay by Jean Cocteau "Le Rappel a I'Ordre," a much earlier one being Apres le Cubisme, published in 1918 by the painter Amedee Ozenfant and the architect Charles-Edouard Jeanneret (later known as Le Corbusier). But what all these calls to order have in common is the idea that the prewar period was defined by chaos, by a decadent sensuality that needed to be replaced by the purity of classical rationalism, and by the barbarization of French culture by German influences. In fact, Ozenfant and Jeanneret called on artists to focus on the golden section and other ideas of classical proportion, making it possible for there to be a "new Pythagoras." "Science and great Art have the common ideal of generalizing," they wrote. Arguing that if "The Greeks triumphed over the Barbarians" it was because they sought intellectual beauty beneath sensory beauty. Two versions of this classicism are represented by these two tracts, however. The first, Purism, has a modem, streamlined look, and speaks the language of science and of general laws, such as proportion. It argues that the artist-designer should dedicate himself to industry, producing for it the generalized types associated with classical forms. The second has a reactionary, Old Master character and recycles the themes and genres of the neoclassical art it wishes to revive. The mother-and-child theme became a preferred one-taken up by former Cubists such as Gino Severini as well as modified ones such as Albert Gleizes-as did the tradition of the commedia del'arte. Severini's clowns and harlequins, painted in the early twenties in the hard outlines and licked surfaces of the most academicized classicism, are determined examples of the latter.

        Neoclassicism
      </h4>
      <p>
        Now understood to describe the classicizing style which evolved in European art of the later 18th and early 19th centuries in reaction to the florid sensuality of the Rococo. It embraced the fine and decorative arts and architecture, and its masters included the painter David (The Oath of the Horatii, Louvre, Paris), the sculptor Canova, and the architects Ledoux and Soane. The term was actually devised later, in the 1880s, and was originally pejorative, denoting 'pseudo-classical', and particularly directed at Jacques-Louis David and his school. Neoclassicism is now seen to have achieved a purity of expression, however, and would have been referred to by its practitioners as the 'true' or 'correct' style. It was based on the study of antique art, which was to be imitated but not slavishly copied, and thus embody what were perceived to be the general and permanent principles of the visual arts as formulated by the ancients. Its first great theorist was J. J. Winckelmann (1717–68), whose Reflections on the Painting and Sculpture of the Greeks was published in English translation in 1765.
