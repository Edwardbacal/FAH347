      Art History is a discpline founded on Western cultural and intellectual foundations. And while it has spread to instutions all over the world, those foundations inform how the history of art is written. This is particularly true when it comes to the notion of <strong>influence</strong> and of <strong>"centre and periphery."</strong>  
    </h5>
    
    <p>
      Outside the centre of the Western art "world," peripheral practices are often doomed to be looked down on as derivative (just copying Western styles that were invented decades before), or as "lower art" (e.g. as folk art / craft / design or other kinds of "fine art"). And when they're not, they're often regarded as anomalies or are exoticised.

        "Art since 1900 touches on a few isolated samples of postwar diaspora art and Asian avant-garde movements, but these owe their presence more to what they mean to the West than for their intrinsic worth. In consequence, they tend to come off as bit players in the master narrative. Thus, despite the above inclusions, the canon is not significantly enlarged. Rather, the non-Western artists are brought in primarily on account of their compatibility with the avant-garde discourse in the West."

      <p>
        By talking about these artists in terms of their relation to Cubism (or Western modernism), we're already caught in a trap that positions them as "peripheral." How can we talk about these artists from a perspective that is both local and global, without also making them a placeholder for their nationality/ethnicity?
      </p>
      
      <h5>
        Or as Partha Mitter writes:
      </h5>
      
      <p>
        "we must seek explanatory tools that adequately describe art practices and their social and cultural milieus in the so-called outlying areas, taking into account the peculiar contextual needs and expressions of regional artistic productions and consumptions, along with the local assertions of global concerns."
      </p>
      
      <p>
        And to...
      </p>
      
      <p>
        "pay closer attention to particular art histories, the contexts of their ideologies, contradictions, and fractures in their engagement with modernity. To my mind, multiple local possibilities illuminate the global processes of modernity more effectively than a grand globalizing narrative, which is more likely than not to perpetuate a relationship of power."
      </p>
      
      <p> 
        In short, this means NOT regarding the history of art as a unified, linear path led by Europeans and Americans, with non-Western artists showing up late to the game with inferior copies. Instead, we can look at the multi-directional exchange of influence ("the global process of cross-fertilization"), in which the adoption of foreign styles means different things in different contexts.

        The "enormous achievements of the heroic age of the avant-garde cannot be gainsaid, as the modernist technology of art, not to mention the formal language and syntax of Cubism, allowed artists in far-flung regions to devise new ways to image the visible world. One of the favorite projects of the colonial powers in the nineteenth century was to inculcate "good taste" in the subject nations through the introduction of academic naturalism and classical standards. Therefore, the revolt of the Western avant-garde against academic naturalism and its attendant ideology was openly welcomed by the subject nations, who were concerned with formulating their own resistance to the colonial order."

      Gaganendranath Tagore
    </h2>
    
    <p>
      Gaganendranath Tagore (17 September 1867 – 14 February 1938)[1] was an Bengali painter and cartoonist of the Bengal school. Along with his brother Abanindranath Tagore, he was counted as one of the earliest modern artists in India.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between 1920 and 1925, Gaganendranath pioneered experiments in modernist painting.[3] Partha Mitter describes him as "the only Indian painter before the 1940s who made use of the language and syntax of Cubism in his painting".[4] From 1925 onwards, the artist developed a complex post-cubist style.

          Analytic Cubism, which destroyed the conventions of illusionistic naturalism, helped to restore the internal cohesion of a picture so that it ceased to be a window on the external world. Artists worldwide were drawn to Cubism's flexible nonfigurative syntax, which could be put to different uses, but they were not concerned with the formal revolution of Analytic Cubism as such.
        </p>
        <p>
          ...the use of Cubism, a product of the dominant West, by an Indian artist who belonged to the colonized world, immediately locked him into a dependent relationship, the colonized mimicking the superior art of the colonizer. Archer's analysis of modern art in India rests on reductionist criteria employed by art historians to describe the reception of Western art in the periphery: while successful imitation was a form of aping, imperfect imitation represented a failure of learning.

          Diego Rivera
        </h2>
        <p>
          Rivera is best known for leading the more formally conventional Mexican Mural movement of the 20s and 30s* (see the work on the right for reference), which eclipses his earlier participation in Cubism. Rivera was working throughout Europe in the first half of the 1910s; most notably, he moved to Paris in 1912 where he was acquainted with artists such as Picasso, Piet Mondriaan, and others. Rivera, watching the Mexican Revolution unfold from abroad, absorbed the formal experiments of the Parisian art scene while developing a visual style and iconography to match the new post-revolutionary Mexican identity.   
        </p>

            In the distinct brand of Cubism that he developed while living temporarily in Paris, Rivera used small dots of color, a technique known as Pointillism, to amplify contrasts in texture and pattern. Here, the sleek bottle of green liquid, presumably absinthe, and shiny metal spoon, necessary for preparing the potent drink, are paired against a strip of camouflage tablecloth, a reference to World War I. Additionally, he includes references to his homeland, such as the cigar box with a partial label reading BENITO JUA underneath a miniature Mexican landscape. This label refers to Benito Juárez, the President of Mexico from 1858 until his death in 1872.

        <img src="assets/11/Diego Rivera - Zapatista Landscape - 1915.com" alt="" style=" max-height: 90vh;">
        <span class="hoverCap">
          <p>
            Learning from Pablo Picasso, with whom he socialized during a lengthy sojourn in Paris in the 1910s, Rivera applied the Spaniard's groundbreaking Cubist style to a riveting representation of Emiliano Zapata Salazar.
          </p>
          <p>
            Zapata was leader of a critically important peasant revolt south of Mexico City during the Mexican revolution. Rivera applied Picasso's Cubism — a revolution in seeing — to a revolutionary subject.
          </p>
          <p>
            His image is loosely based on a widely circulated photograph of Zapata, his hand brandishing a rifle at his side. He wears a broad-brimmed sombrero, a striped serape and cartridge belts crisscrossed over his body.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rivera's fractured Cubist planes capture all these scrappy elements in a tight, central cluster that, while not exactly forming a figure, nonetheless suggests a human torso and head. Four feet tall, the canvas creates an inescapable bodily correspondence between the revolutionary Cubist figure being depicted and its observant viewer. Shifting Cubist planes of vibrant color set the figure in action.
          </p>
          <p>
            Several depicted objects are more realist, which adds to the visual disjunction. One is the rifle, its narrow, steel-gray form enlarged and pushed into the visual foreground by a sharply delineated white shape, which cuts across the composition on a diagonal. Behind it is a wood-grained ammunition box, which slyly corresponds to Zapata's body.
          </p>
          <p>
            The landscape is another realist element. Behind the nominal figure is a ghostly volcanic mountain range like the one that encircles Mexico City and, over the figure's shoulder on the right, what might be mesas or possibly chopped tree stumps. Two clumps of leafy green trees, one on each side of the torso, are placed like ornamental epaulets on a soldier's uniform.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bright blue sky across the lower half is matched by a sickly greenish veil above the mountains on top. Topsy-turvy colors signifying earth and sky together evoke a world turned upside down.
          </p>
          <p>
            The painting was produced early in a celebrated career that would expand for four decades. Yet it's no wonder Rivera described it as “probably the most faithful expression of the Mexican mood that I have ever achieved.” Cubism isn't known for expressing feeling, which makes Rivera's work distinctive.
          </p>
          <p>
            Needless to say, the landscape in “Zapatista Landscape” is of extreme importance. Agrarian reform was a crucial aim of the Mexican Revolution that was unfolding while Rivera was abroad. Territorial takeover in the Spanish conquest of Mexico had evolved over centuries into a system of vast private estates controlled by a small class of powerful landowners.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nineteenth-century Mexican landscape painting sought to fuse national identity with the land, just like similar imagery in other North American and European art. Zapata's peasant revolt in rural Morelos hinged on the refusal of the Mexican government to enact the agrarian reforms that had been demanded and, tentatively at least, promised. Rivera's Cubist masterpiece, painted when he was just 29, brilliantly fuses the land, revolution and the peasantry — with Zapata as its modern emblem.

    <h2>
      Wifredo Lam
    </h2>
    <p>
      A true one-of-a-kind artist, Lam embodies the notion of hybridity. Born and raised in Cuba, of mixed Chinese, European, Indian, and African ancestry, raised Catholic but interested in Afro-Caribbean spirituality, Lam studied art in Spain and established his career in Paris, where he was exposed to styles such as Cubism and Surrealism. 
    </p>
    
    <div class="img" style="margin: 10vw 0;">

        <span class="hoverCap">
          <p>
            Lam, who had spent three years working with the Surrealists in Paris, aimed for The Jungle to convey the haunting consequences of slavery and colonialism for his native island of Cuba. He depicted figures with crescent-shaped faces, recalling African or Pacific Islander masks, against a background of Cuban sugarcane fields. Cuba, one of the world's largest sugar exporters, had been colonized since the sixteenth century, and the Atlantic slave trade had brought more than a million Africans there as labor for the country's plantations. “I wanted with all my heart to paint the drama of my country,” Lam wrote, “to disturb the dreams of the exploiters.”
          </p>

          </cite>
          <p>
            [After moving to Spain from Havana in 1923], Lam experienced European artistic practices firsthand, working and studying with radical, nonconformist painters and absorbing early influences from the compositions of Paul Cézanne and Paul Gauguin during regular visits to museums. He moved to Paris in 1938, where he met Pablo Picasso. The elder artist became his friend and supporter, introducing him into his circle of Cubists and other avant-garde artists. In 1939, Lam met poet and founder of Surrealism André Breton and became associated with the Surrealist movement, which affected his style. Working mainly in gouache, he began painting fantastical figures with fragmented, geometrical bodies and often with a combination of human and animal parts and faces resembling the African carvings that so fascinated him and his peers.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1941, Lam returned to Cuba. Moved by the hardships of his country's black population and fascinated by their worship rituals, he aimed to express their culture through his art. He blended elements of Cubism, Surrealism, African, and Afro-Cuban art in paintings that became further dominated by his combined human-animal figures, which seemed to fuse with the lush, tropical flora that sometimes surrounded them.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1943, Wifredo Lam was in the midst of re-acquainting himself with his native Cuba, especially its population of African descent. “I wanted with all my heart to paint the drama of my country, but by thoroughly expressing the black spirit, the beauty of the plastic art of the blacks,” he once said. “I knew I was running the risk of not being understood. … But a true picture has the power to set the imagination to work even if it takes time.”2 The “true picture” of which he spoke is his monumental painting The Jungle (1943).
          </p>
          <p>
            Lam painted The Jungle during a flowering of interest in Afro-Cuban traditions by writers, artists, and intellectuals. The artist's own family included people of African descent. Already immersed in African art during his time in Paris, in Cuba he began to frequent Santería ceremonies. Originally enslaved by Spanish and Portuguese traders and brought to the island to work its sugarcane fields, Africans were forced to abandon their native beliefs and convert to Catholicism. In response, they overlaid their own traditions onto Catholicism (creating Santería), while continuing to practice their religions, such as Voodoun, in secret, in such hidden settings as the jungle that crowds Lam's painting.

            In The Jungle, Lam blends Afro-Cuban and African artistic and cultural traditions with the European modernist movements of Cubism and Surrealism. At nearly eight feet high by just over seven-and-a-half feet wide, this gouache on paper and canvas composition can feel immersive, or engulfing. Four part-human, part-animal figures, with exaggerated hands and feet and faces recalling African masks, stand side-by-side. In Cubist fashion, their bodies are fragmented into individual parts that do not seem to fit together logically. With their fantastic appearance, they seem as if they could have sprung from the artist's dreams or possibly from his unconscious, the workings of the mind that especially interested the Surrealists.
          </p>
          <p>
            The figures seem to simultaneously emerge from and merge with a dense wall of vegetation composed of thick, banded stalks suggestive of the sugarcane that grew in the fields the slaves worked. The rightmost figure holds a pair of shears, a possible reference to harvesting, while the leftmost figure, with its horse-like features, could be seen to hint at one of the spirits in Afro-Cuban mysticism. Since Lam chose a color palette of blues and greens, with touches of yellow and white, this could be read as a moonlit night scene, or as taking place during the day, under the cover of the deep shade of the jungle.

            When Wifredo Lam arrived in Paris in 1938 he carried a letter of introduction to Pablo Picasso, with whom he had an immediate rapport. Soon he met many other leading artistic figures, among them André Breton, the dominant publicist and theorist of Surrealism. The Surrealists, who attempted to unleash the power of the unconscious through explorations of dream states and automatist writing, were fascinated by the mythologies of “primitive” people. They subscribed to an anthropology that perceived modern “primitive” cultures as the heirs to an integrated understanding of myth and reality, which they hoped to achieve themselves. Lam, as a Cuban of African, Chinese, and European descent, seemed to the Surrealists to have privileged access to that undifferentiated state of mind. In 1942 the artist returned to Cuba, where he constructed a body of work in a Surrealist idiom, creating symbolic creatures engaged in ritual acts of initiation. Lam's vocabulary of vegetal-animal forms was inspired by Afro-Cuban and Haitian Santeria deities. He also associated with the nationalist poets of the Négritude movement, who relied in their work on the images and rhythms of their native culture.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rumblings of the Earth represents a synthesis of Lam's concerns in his work of the 1940s. This painting melds his reaction to the European artistic legacy with his own goals and the indigenous traditions of his country. Here, Lam referred to Picasso's 1937 Guernica through direct quotations and more abstract correspondences, but he transformed Picasso's political statement by replacing the central victim of Guernica, the horse, with a spectral presence bearing a large knife, described by Lam as “the instrument of integrity.” An aggressive painting, Rumblings of the Earth includes vaginal and phallic references that focus the work thematically on the cycle of birth and death while suggesting ritual initiation and violence. For Lam, revolutionary violence was a means of liberation; in his hands, the victim in Picasso's canvas has become the aggressor.
            
          </p>
          <p>
            In Zambezia, Zambezia Lam depicted an iconic woman partly inspired by the femme-cheval (horse-headed woman) of the Santeria cult. He frequently used the device of transmogrification of body parts to suggest magical metamorphosis, inspired by indigenous American and African ritual objects. In this painting it is manifested in the testicle “chin” of the figure.

      Tarsila do Amaral
    </h2>
    <p>
      “I want to be the painter of my country,” wrote Tarsila do Amaral (1886–1973) in 1923.... She studied piano, sculpture, and drawing before leaving for Paris in 1920 to attend the Académie Julian, the famous art school that drew many international students. During subsequent sojourns in the French capital, she studied with André Lhote, Albert Gleizes, and Fernand Léger, fulfilling what she called her "military service in Cubism," ultimately arriving at her signature style of sensuous, vibrant landscapes and everyday scenes. The exhibition (Tarisla do Amaral: Inventing Modern Art in Brazil) focuses on her pivotal production from the 1920s, when she navigated the art worlds of both São Paulo and Paris, and charts her involvement with an increasingly international artistic community, as well as her critical role in the emergence of modernism in Brazil. In 1928, she painted Abaporu for her husband, the poet Oswalde de Andrade, depicting an elongated, isolated figure with a blooming cactus. This landmark painting inspired the Manifesto of Anthropophagy, and became the banner for a transformative artistic movement, which imagined a specifically Brazilian culture arising from the symbolic digestion—or artistic “cannibalism”—of outside influences.

            Curator, Luis Perez-Oramas: Abaporu, a word constituted by two Tupi-Guarani words meaning "the man who eats human flesh," was painted by Tarsila in 1928 in order to be given as a birthday gift to her husband, Oswald de Andrade.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tarsila do Amaral: I wanted to make a picture that would startle Oswald, something really out of the ordinary. The Abaporu was that monstrous figure, the little head, the skinny little arm supported by an elbow, those enormous long legs, and next to it a cactus that looked like a sun, as if it were a flower and the sun at the same time. So, when he saw the picture, Oswald was extremely startled and asked, “But what is this? What an extraordinary thing!”
          </p>
          <p>
            ** Luis Perez-Oramas:** This painting actually became the signature illustration of the Anthropophagic Manifesto written by Oswald de Andrade. Anthropophagy, or cannibalistic practices, were documented among native Brazilians. In the 1920s avant-garde Paris, there was an obsession with cannibalistic practices from surrealist intellectuals and artists. Oswald took this motif of cannibalism to suggest symbolically ingesting artistic influences from both modern European art and traditional Brazilian culture. The aim was to produce a hybrid style that was distinctly new, and distinctly Brazilian.

        <h3>
          Mavo
        </h3>
        <p>
          Mavo was a radical Japanese art movement of the 1920s. Founded in 1923, Mavo was productive during the late Taishō period (1912–26). Mavo re-instituted the Japanese Association of Futurist Artists, the anarchistic artist group who displayed an outdoor exhibit in Ueno Park in Tokyo in protest of conservatism in the Japanese art world.[1]
          
        </p>
        <p>
          Led by Tomoyoshi Murayama, the group deployed an interdisciplinary array of performance art, painting, illustration and architecture, to communicate anti-establishment messages to the mainstream. Fueled by responses to industrial development, the Mavo group created works about crisis, peril and uncertainty. Art historian Gennifer Weisenfeld has written that Mavo sought to reintegrate art into daily life.[2]
          
        </p>
        <p>
          "Mavoist" artists sought to disrupt or blur the boundaries between art and daily life. They rebelled against the establishment by combining industrial products with painting or printmaking, usually in collage form. Their performance art protests against social injustice deployed theatrical eroticism, that mocked public norms for morality at the time.[3][2]

        <h3>
          Tomoyoshi Murayama
        </h3>
        <p>
          Tomoyoshi Murayama was a multi-disciplinary Japanese artist associated with the interwar avant-garde and leftwing theater movements. After briefly attending Tokyo Imperial University, Murayama moved to Berlin in 1922, where he met Herwarth Walden and participated in The Great Futurist Exhibition at the Galerie Der Sturm. Upon returning to Japan, Murayama held his first solo exhibition in Tokyo in 1923, where he developed a theory of ‘conscious constructivism’ that called for the incorporation of everyday life into aesthetic practice. As the founding member and spokesman of the art collective Mavo, Murayama challenged prevailing notions of pure art—his mixed media assemblages included references to popular culture and industrial materials. In addition to his mixed media pieces, Murayama produced work across a range of media including children’s illustration, commercial design, theater, and film. Murayama’s theater affiliations included the Kokoro-za Theatre and the New Cooperative Theatre, and he designed the constructivist-style set for the Tsukiji Little Theatre production of From Morning Till Midnight (1924). An active member of proletarian art associations, Murayama was detained multiple times under the Peace Preservation Law, and was forced to renounce his political affiliations in 1933. In 1940, the New Cooperative Theatre and New Tsukiji Little Theatre were disbanded, and Murayama imprisoned. Following his sentence, Murayama spent the remainder of the war in Korea and Manchuria, returning to Japan after the war in 1945. His late novel Shinobi no mono (1960–1962) was adapted as a film series, play, and television program. Prior to his death, he completed a four-volume autobiography.
