        I typically give Fs only to work that's noticeably incomplete, plagairised, or shows deliberate neglect. In any case, it shouldn't have to come to that; I'm more concerned with seeing you finish on your terms than failing your work.

          Week 2: The Surreality of the Cinema
        </h4>
        <p>
          In this week's readings, Robert Desnos, Jean Goudal, Jean Vigo, and Andre Breton each reflect on cinema's relation to Surrealism, vis-a-vis the movement's aims and cultural consequences. Reading their articles together, I sense that a Surrealist impulse lends itself particularly well to cinema, or rather, exists at the heart of cinema itself. Just as the previous week's readings analyzed the cinematic medium in order to understand the reality of film form, here we have thinkers seeking cinema's underlying <em>Surreality</em>. To be sure, these thinkers rearticulate many notions the previous articles raise—namely, an emphasis on harnessing the cinematic image's potential— but are no longer concerned with cinema's artistic legitimacy as much as its unprecedented ability to express the unconscious.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Goudal argues, cinema has many characteristics that express Surrealism's aim of opening art to the unexplored regions of the dream. He maintains that what is seen in the cinema corresponds exactly to a conscious hallucination, in that cinema's unique visuality draws us out of reality and immerses us in a vision of the imagination. <sup>1</sup> Moreover, cinema can appear illogical while still holding a “pervasive” effect on viewers, in that filmmakers can communicate their psychic experiences to viewers who can  relate to them on an analogous psychic level.<sup>2</sup> This concern with a Surrealist cine-visuality, theorized in terms of the unconscious experience of viewing recorded images, is similarly evident in Vigo's account of social cinema. Vigo defines this notion as a kind of documentary cinema that is, in distinction to conventional documentaries, rooted in the author's viewpoint. Additionally, he is interested in life caught unawares, which does not reflect the formal ordering of images as much as the psychic reality of looking and perceiving. <sup>3</sup> This is a “social cinema”, then, in that it reflects the unconscious mechanics that underwrite everyday social life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, we can link these concerns to Desnos' concern with eroticism, which he views as a creative force to be expressed in the cinematic image. Along with recognizing that filmgoers are desiring humans, he outlines a certain sensuousness in cinema, an eroticism of the filmic image where flesh can become more real than that of the living and through which cinema acts like a powerful cerebral drug.<sup>4</sup>

        </p>
        <p>
          Many similarities are evident between these writers and earlier ones such as Jean Epstein, Louis Aragon, Antonin Artaud, and Germaine Dullac, who similarly theorize the aesthetics particular to the cinematic image and its visuality. Both are concerned with the subjective vision of an author, with a kind of engrossing and perceptually novel visuality, and with a poetics of the image (for example, Desnos' description of the eroticism of sensuous gestures caught by the camera recalls the notion of <em>photogénie</em>). These writers are also all concerned with the cinematic image's potential and/or intrinsic qualities, and perhaps even with exploring an essence of cinema. As such, considering the extent that film and psychoanalysis have been close theoretical and aesthetic bedfellows—considering that cinema is perhaps more psychoanalytically relevant than other media—I wonder if there is something deeply surreal at the heart of cinema itself. With this in mind, Breton's article, which describes his experience of aimlessly walking in and out of movie theatres, and which illustrates his attraction to cinema's seemingly unrivalled ability to effect disorientation, is perhaps ideal in conceiving the deeply surreal experience cinema offers.<sup>5</sup> It is with cinema's intoxicating potential of conveying and realizing the disorienting non-logic of unconscious life that it expresses its surreality.
