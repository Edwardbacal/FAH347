            Over the last century, Cubism has stood as one of art history's best known movements, and its biggest star, Picasso, has stayed a household name. There's no question Cubism is foundational to modern art, but it's worth asking what makes this movement, and its various counterparts, compelling to eminent art historians and casual museum-goers alike? What about this eccentric, sometimes baffling style, continues to demand our attention? And what can we say about it from our current vantage point?
          </p>
          <p>
            To understand Cubism's place in art history, this course analyzes the social, cultural, and political contexts in which it developed. Moreover, we'll follow the movements that intersect with Cubism (e.g. Italian and Russian Futurism, Orphism, Vorticism, Purism), alongside farther flung examples of its influence. What begins with a new, distinctly modern way of seeing the world unfolds into a universe of artists and writers, all working to make sense of cataclysmic shifts.
          </p>
          <p>
            The course is loosely organized by chronology and geography. The first half is concerned with Cubism-proper, focusing on the creation and evolution of Cubist painting and collage in France. The second half examines how Cubism's influence spread beyond France, morphing into different styles with different ideologies.
            
            This content is a mix of <em>greatest hits</em> — major artists and famous works — and <em>deeper cuts</em> — lesser known figures from around the world. Indeed, the seeds of Cubism sprout in many different places by way of many different people. And things get all the more interesting when we step away from the stories of European men that typically dominate modernism. So, while honouring art history's established foundations, we'll also pay attention to the polyphony of narratives that make up a more diverse tangle of histories.

            An effective course is just-confusing-enough: challenging but not overwhelming. Ideally, students will finish this course having grasped about 80% of it (the other 20% is where the best learning happens). How that happens, though, is different for everyone, depending on how you learn and what you want from your education. Above all, I hope you will pursue what's meaningful to you while exercising an open mind. That said...
          </p>
          <p>
            My aim is for students to
          </p>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>
              Develop intellectual skills with which to discuss art from critical and analytical positions: to understand art's history and contexts while interpreting it from an informed, present-day perspective.
            </li>
            <li>
              Nurture curiosity and creativity and to experience new connections to art and ideas. I hope this course makes you feel excited about art and excited to participate in conversations about it.   
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <h5>
            At the end of this course, you "should" be able to do the following:
          </h5>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>
              Perform visual and theoretical analyses of artworks. 
            </li>
            <li>
              Identify artworks in relation to movement, period, and style.
            </li>
            <li>
              Interpret artworks in relation to their social, political, and cultural histories.
            </li>
            <li>
              Understand relevant art historical debates about artists and art movements.
            </li>
            <li>
              Effectively read and write art historical scholarship.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Active engagement is essential to an effective learning experience and this class features discussion periods and informal activities that contribute to your grade. With these, I intend to give space to express the diverse reactions, impressions, and sensations we experience around art.

To ensure your email makes it to my inbox, please use your mail.utoronto.ca address and include “FAH347” in the subject line. Kindly allow up to 48 hours for a reply. If you intend to contest a grade, please wait a full day before contacting me, and include a short description of your concern. You are expected to regularly check your email and Quercus for updates and announcements (not doing so is <em>not</em> a valid excuse in cases of conflict).

            Conduct
          </h3>
          <p>
            Everyone is expected to treat the class (including all course activity outside of class and online) as a safe space. Belligerent, offensive, or disrespectful behaviours and attitudes will not be tolerated. I encourage students to challenge and be challenged by ideas, but not without respecting the rights and values of others. This means respecting differences in gender expression, sexuality, race, religion, ability, social and cultural background, etc. 
          </p>
          <p>
            This course features material some may find discomforting (e.g., topics of gender, sexuality, colonialism, war, and class). While I maintain a non-partisan stance, there is no such thing as an neutral course and students should not expect this one to conform to their personal worldviews.
          </p>
          <p>
            Students that neglect these guidelines or that disrupt the class may be asked to leave.

            Academic integrity is real! This is not just another boilerplate warning. Investing honour and authenticity into your work is matter of ethics and a skill for success throughout your education and even life. If you get anything from this course, let it be the value of original thought that honours the other voices that make up the conversation.

            This option comprises <strong>five</strong> separate journal entries, each between 500-700 words, containing academic responses to weekly readings. Each entry should address one week's main AND additional readings.

          <p>
            Let's say I choose to write on <a href="#c3">class #3</a> for one of my journals. I'll read that week's main reading (Cubism, pg. 71 - 170) and <em>all</em> of its additional readings. Maybe I find some interesting parallels or distinctions between these readings, or I connect them to a work from class, or this material sparks some interesting questions, or I have impressions I want to explore. From this, I write a concise article, from my own point of view, that synthesizes the readings (with citations, using Chicago style) and my commentary. I make sure to proofread and revise this entry over time. I do all this for four other classes.

                Let's say I have an idea related to Cubism and/or its related movements that I'd like to explore in detail. I briefly run it by the instructor or TA to make sure it's feasible. I then write a 500-700 word outline that describes the following:
              </p> 
              <ul class="list">
                <li>
                  The specific topic I am exploring, including a tentative thesis and a list of the artists/works/stuff I plan to discuss. 
                </li>
                <li>
                  A brief overview of what research on the topic in available and what sources I plan to draw on <strong>(this must go beyond course readings)</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The academic approach or method I plan to pursue in my essay.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Why I think this is a topic worth discussing.
                </li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>
                When my proposal is returned, I consider the feedback I received as I complete the essay. I cite all of my sources, via endnotes or footnotes, using Chicago Style. I carefully proofread and revise my essay over time.

                    This assignment asks you to create a diagrammatic timeline that details a historical period relevant to Cubism – not the history of Cubism itself but a chosen path (or paths) that runs through it. In addition to outlining the period's historical details (relevant events, individuals, artworks, institutions, texts, etc.) your timeline should make a larger art historical argument with its own thesis. Consider what you say about art through the way you present it — through what you choose to include and exclude and how you connect the dots.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This timeline is no point-form list. At the least, you should generously illustrate it with visual examples and textual citations; more importantly, it's an opportunity to creatively engage with art history using different media. There is no precribed way to to make this timeline, it can be a PDF, a poster, a slide-show, a story, a website, a video, an audio-installation, a mural, a performance... I encourage you to experiment and have fun with it. You won't be graded on your creative skills, but you should be deliberate about your timeline's form, format, and media, and how those things shape your message.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In addition to the timeline itself, you will have to provide a supporting statement (500-700 words) to explain the following:
                  </p>
                  <ul class="list">
                    <li>
                      The specific history your timeline documents and why you chose it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      What this timeline teaches us about the period it details - what art historical thesis does it arrive at?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      What motivated your choice of details to include (or not include) and your choice of medium/format.
