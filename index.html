            Over the last century, Cubism has stood as one of art history's best known movements, and its biggest star, Pablo Picasso, has stayed a household name. It's worth asking what makes this movement, along with its various counterparts, consistently compelling to both art historians and museum-goers. What about this eccentric, sometimes baffling style, continues to demand our attention? And what can we learn from our contemporary vantage point? To understand Cubism's place in art history, this course analyzes the social, cultural, and political contexts in which Cubism developed. Moreover, we'll follow the movements that intersect with Cubism (e.g. Italian and Russian Futurism, Purism, Orphism, Vorticism), alongside farther flung examples of its influence. What begins with a new, distinctly modern way of seeing the world unfolds into a universe of artists and writers, all working to make sense of cataclysmic shifts.   
          </p>
          <p>
            The course is more or less structured by chronology, beginning with the influence of post-Impressionism and focusing on the development of Analytic and Synthetic Cubism. We will then examine how these advances, spreading beyond Paris, morphed into different styles with different ideologies. And we will consider the legacy of these movements through to the present.
            
            Course content is a mix of <em>greatest hits</em> — major artists and famous works — and <em>deeper cuts</em> — lesser known figures from around the world. Indeed, the seeds of Cubism pop up in many different places by way of many different people, so things get really interesting when we step away from the stories of European men that typically dominate modernism. So,while honouring art history's established foundations, we will also pay attention to the polyphony of narratives that make up a broader, more diverse tangle of histories.
          </p>
          <p>
            Readings principally consist of chapters from the textbook <em>Art Since 1900</em>, interspersed with primary texts and critical essays.

            An effective course is challenging but not overwhelming. My aim is for you to complete this course having grasped about 75% of it (the other 25% is where the best learning happens). How that happens, however, will be different for different students; I encourage you to pursue what's meaningful to you while exercising an open mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            On one hand, my aim is for students to develop intellectual skills with which to discuss art from critical and analytical positions: to understand art's history and context while being able to interpret it from an informed, present-day perspective.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other, my aim is for students to nurture their curiosity and creativity and to experience new connections to art and ideas. I hope this course will make you feel excited about art, and excited to contribute something to conversations about it.   
          </p>
          <h5>
            At the end of this course, you should be able to do the following:
          </h5>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>
              Perform visual and theoretical analyses of artworks. 
            </li>
            <li>
              Identify artworks in relation to movement, period, and style.
            </li>
            <li>
              Interpret artworks in relation to their social, political, and cultural histories.
            </li>
            <li>
              Understand relevant art historical debates about artists and art movements.
            </li>
            <li>
              Effectively read and write art historical scholarship.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Because active engagement is essential to an effective learning experience, this class features discussion periods and informal activities. I intend to give space to express the diverse reactions, impressions, and sensations we experience around art.

            Communication
          </h3>
          <p>
            You are welcome to discuss course matters after class, by email, or during office hours (by appointment over zoom). To ensure your email makes it to my inbox, please use your mail.utoronto.ca address and include “FAH347” in the subject line. Kindly allow up to 48 hours for a reply. If you intend to contest a grade, please wait a full day before contacting me, and include a short description of your concern. You are expected to regularly check your email and Quercus for course updates and announcements (not doing so is <em>not</em> a valid excuse in cases of conflict).
          </p>
          
          <h3>
            Conduct
          </h3>
          <p>
            Everyone is expected to treat the class (including all course activity outside of class and online) as a safe space. Belligerent, offensive, or disrespectful behaviours and attitudes will not be tolerated. I encourage students to challenge and be challenged by ideas, but not without respecting the rights and values of others. This means respecting differences in gender expression, sexuality, race, religion, ability, social and cultural background, etc. 
          </p>
          <p>
            This course features material some may find uncomfrtable (e.g., topics of gender, sexuality, colonialism, war, and class). While I maintain a non-partisan stance, there is no such thing as an neutral course and students should not expect this one to conform to their personal worldviews.
          </p>
          <p>
            Students that neglect these guidelines or that disrupt the class may be asked to leave.
          </p>

            Brains are weird. Bodies are weird. Let's not pretend there's a one-size-fits-all approach to educating a room of cognitively diverse and differently abled students. As such, I encourage you to address difficulties you may experience in the course and to take advantage of resources that help you to meet your learning needs.

            Academic Integrity (a/k/a Plagiarism: Don't Do It!)
          </h3>
          <p>
            Academic integrity is real! This is not just another administrative warning, investing honour and authenticity into your work is matter of ethics and a skill for success throughout your education and even life. If you get anything from this course, let it be the value of original thought that honours the other voices that make up the conversation.

          <p>
            Also: <br>
            Students must act in accordance and familiarize themselves with the University's <a href="https://www.governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/policies/behaveac.htm" target="_blank"></a> “Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters”. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Ignorance of these rules is not a valid excuse for breaking them.

            This assignment asks you to write four separate journal entries that present academic responses to course readings. Each entry should be between 500-700 words long (roughly 1.5-2 pages), based on an individual class of your choice. For each entry, you must discuss two of the textbook chapters and one of the recommended primary-source readings from an individual class (do not mix texts from different weeks). To help guide you, I've included questions about each class in the course schedule. I encourage you to refer to these, though I also encourage you to pursue your own questions.
