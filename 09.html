        Modernity in Eastern Europe: A new art for a new subject for a new society
      </h3>
      
      <h5>
        If the Western experience of modernity was shaped by the "shock" of rapid urbanization, industrialization, and technological change, in a capitalist context, Russian modernism was shaped by the societal transformations surrounding the Revolution that would begin in 1917, and was much more <em>formal</em> in its methods and styles.   
      </h5>
      
      <h5>
        Hence, a thorough rejection of older bourgeois ideas of art, combined with attempts to create art forms that would play an active role in constructing a new society.
      </h5>
      
      <h5>
        Russian modernism was also tuned into linguistic and literary theory (so called Russian Formalism) concerned with the construction of meaning through signs.
      </h5>

        Russia was also a leading

          "What happened from the social aspect in 1917," (Vladimir) Tatlin wrote, "was realized in our work as pictorial artists in 1914, when 'materials, volume, and construction' were accepted as our foundations." Such materialist foundations were achieved in Constructivist art, Tatlin implies, before they were established in Communist society.

        First, Duchamp and Tatlin were responding in different ways to a crisis in representation signaled by Cubism. Second, that crisis had revealed a truth about "bourgeois" art, both academic and avant-garde, to which the two artists were also responding-that it was presumed to be autonomous, separate from social life, an instituion in its own right.... Once valued as the sign of artistic freedom, according to (theorist Peter Burger), this autonomy had become the mark of its "social ineffectuality," and this in turn prompted "the self-critique of art" advanced paradigmatically by Duchamp and Tatlin.

        In his constructions Tatlin reversed the thrust of this anti-
        illusionism in order to direct the viewer not to a transcendental realm of God but to an immanent reality of materials. In effect, he used the Russian icon as Picasso had used the African mask: as a "witness" to his own analytical development of modernist precedents, as a guide to an art no longer governed by resemblance.

        By 1912, Picasso and Braque had pushed Cubism to its limits.

        The experimentation that took them through synthetic cubism, collage, and construction brought them to a kind of cul-de-sac. As Picasso & Braque reverted to more conventional styles, and as their peers followed their work by developing different strains of painting and sculpture, both abstract and figurative, artists in Eastern Europe would arguably do the most to carry on the line of experimentation Cubism started.

              Tatlin is already on the threshold of Constructivism. The frame remains, but the materials are no longer composed pictorially. An iron triangle projects into space, in contrast with a wooden rod set at an angle in the stucco surface; below and above are two further juxtapositions of curved metal and cut glass. Selection has the character of a demonstration: it first lists its materials, then allows intrinsic properties to suggest appropriate forms. "The material dictates the forms, and not the opposite," critic Nikolai Tarabukin wrote in a 1916 definition of Constructivism based on such works. "Wood, metal, glass, etc. impose different constructions." For Tatlin, machined wood was square and planar, and so suggested rectilinear forms; metal could be cut and bent, and so suggested curvilinear forms; glass was somewhere in between, with a transparency that might also mediate between interior and exterior surfaces. How different this materialism is from the ambiguity of Cubist constructions! Far from the "arbitrary," Tatlin sought to make his constructions "necessary" through this "truth to materials," an ur-modernist aesthetic that tended also to be an ethics and, after the Russian Revolution, a politics as well.

          These "corner counter-reliefs" were complex constructions of metal planes, squared and curved, perpendicular and angular. Not painting, sculpture, or architecture, they were "counters" to all three arts that activated materials,spaces, and viewers in new ways.
