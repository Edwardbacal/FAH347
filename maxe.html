          Instructions
        </h3>
        <p>
          Below are three separate question groupings, for short, medium, and long answer questions.  Answer <strong class="blue">one</strong> question from <strong>each</strong> group (just to be clear, you'll answer a total of three questions, each of different length).
        </p>
        <p>
          This exam isn't designed to take a week; I'm setting aside the full week for you to produce your best work, including time for editing, reviewing/finding texts, and to work at your pace.  
        </p>
        <p>
          Because this is an open-book exam, you are expected to actively reference and cite scholarship in your answers. References need not be limited to course readings, you are welcome – encouraged even – to use additional sources (that is, scholarly articles, books, or chapters that are <em>directly relevant</em> to the exam questions).
        </p>
        <p>
          The best answers will demonstrate a strong understanding of course material by...
        </p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>
            Clearly outlining the historical, cultural, and theoretical context of the topic (the "what happened" and "why it matters" of it).     
          </li>
          <li>
            Using appropriate scholarly texts, in appropriate places, to support your explanations, and to reference other interpretations of it (the "who has said what about it").   
          </li>
          <li>
            Balancing explanation and scholarly references with your own analysis and interpretation (the "this is what I think of all this" of it). 
          </li>
          <li>
            Identifying connections between <strong>form</strong> (what a work looks like, how it was made, what medium it uses, etc.), <strong>content</strong> (what a work says or is about, what symbols it uses, and its interpretations), and <strong>context</strong> (when and why a work was made, who the artist is, where it was shown, etc.). You may focus on one or two of these aspects, but remember that they don't exist in isolation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Being specific and going beyond what was outlined in the course (I'm not looking for you to repeat back what I've said, but to take that and dig deeper: (teach <em>me</em> something!)
          </li>
          <li>
            Distinguishing your answers - repeating the same information across different exam questions will not help your grade.

          Group A - Short Answer Questions (~ 300 - 500 words)
        </h4>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>
            A1: Choose a single work from this course that you believe is essential to the development of modern art. What makes this work stand out? What role does it play in the history of art? 
          </li>
          <li>
            A2: Who is an artist you believe was under-represented or neglected in this course. Why is their work worth talking about? What's lost by ignoring them? 
          </li>
          <li>
            A3: Choose one year from the period of 1906 - 1930 that you think is particularly important or interesting. What makes this year stand out in the history of art? What happened to make it relevant?

        <ul class="list">
          <li>
            <p>
              B1: Artists are just one part of art history: gallerists, art dealers, and writers are integral to all of the movements we've studied. Focusing on one movement from the course, discuss the role such figures played in its development.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              B2: The way we use language and signs is a major point of interest in the history of modern art. Discuss the ways linguistics and semiotics inform the artists and movements we've discussed, and the ways artists and critics have informed our understanding of language and sign systems.   
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            B3: National context (including but not limited to cultural heritage, political history, language, location, and relation to other nations) plays a big role in artistic development. The country/countries an artist is from, visits, or settles in affects the art they make; sometimes their art influences nations too. Discuss how national context shapes the work of <em>one</em> artist from this course.

              C1: Art and politics are closely intertwined throughout this course, whether it's artists referencing political events in their work, creating art to usher in a new society, or consorting with political leaders. From the artists, writers, and movements we've studied throughout this course, discuss how we can best understand the relation between art/aesthetics and society/politics?

              In what ways are socio-political changes evident in the development of artistic techniques and styles, and vice versa?
            </p>
            <p>
              How are political circumstances manifest in artworks? (Pro-tip: it's not just the explicitly political work - the subtle/implicitly political works are just as important!)

          <li>
            <p>
              C2: Art and technology are closely intertwined throughout this course. As new technologies introduce new processes, materials, and sensations, we also get new ways of making and viewing art. From the artists, writers, and movements we've studied throughout this course <cite>(and not <em>just</em> Futurism!)</cite>, discuss how we can best understand the relation between art/aesthetics and technology?
