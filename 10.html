        The experimentation that took them through synthetic cubism, collage, and construction brought them to a kind of cul-de-sac. As Picasso & Braque reverted to more conventional styles, and as their peers followed their work by developing different strains of painting and sculpture, both abstract and figurative, artists in Eastern Europe would do much to build on and advance the line of experimentation Cubism started.

      <h3>
        Modernity in Eastern Europe: A new art for a new subject for a new society
      </h3>
      
      <p>
        If the Western experience of modernity was shaped by the "shock" of rapid urbanization, industrialization, and technological change—that is, by the manifestations of capitalist development—Russian modernism was shaped by the societal transformations surrounding the Revolution of 1917-23.   
      </p>
      <p>
        That meant much more emphasis on rejecting older, bourgeois notions of art, combined with attempts to create art forms that would play an active role in constructing a new society. This made for art that was much more <em>formal</em> in both method and style.
      </p>
      <p>
        Russian modernism was also tuned into linguistic and literary theory (so called Russian Formalism), which was concerned with the construction of meaning through signs.
      </p>
      
      <div class="igBox">
        <p>
          The "crisis in representation signaled by Cubism... had revealed a truth about "bourgeois" art, both academic and avant-garde, to which the (Duchamp and Vladimir Tatlin - more on him later) were also responding-that it was presumed to be autonomous, separate from social life, an instituion in its own right.... Once valued as the sign of artistic freedom, according to (theorist Peter Burger), this autonomy had become the mark of its "social ineffectuality," and this in turn prompted "the self-critique of art" advanced paradigmatically by Duchamp and Tatlin.
        </p>

        A bit more on Russian Formalism:

        <p>
          "Right from the start, the issue at stake [for Russian Formalists, such as Roman Jakobson and Viktor Shklovsky] seems to have been: "What is it that makes a work literary; what is literariness as such?" </p>
          <cite>
            (We can likewise ask what makes and artwork art?)
          </cite>
          <p>
            The question was polemical, directed against almost any trend of
            literary studies at the time: against the Symbolists, for whom the
            text was a transparent vehicle for a transcendent image; against the
            positivists and the psychologists, for whom the biography of tbe
            writer or his putative intention were the determining factors; and against the sociologists, for whom the truth of a literary text was to be found in the historical context of its formation and the political·ideological content it conveyed. For the Formalists, the literariness of a text was a product of its structure, from the phonetical level to the syntactic, from the microsemantic unit of the word to that of the plot. The literary text to them was an organized whole, whose elements
            and devices had first to be analyzed, almost in a chemical fashion
            (" isolated and laid bare just as they are in a Cubist painting," as
            Jakobson wrote) befo re anything could be said of its signification." ...
            The real source of this parallel was the belief on the part of painter
            and critic alike in the power of art to renew perception. For the Formalist critic this meant showing how an author's use of language differs from our ordinary use, how commonsense language is "made strange" within the text; Shklovsky called such a critical move one oflaying bare the aesthetic "device." For the painter this
            meant "de-automatizing" vision so as to confront the viewer with
            the fact that pictorial signs are not transparent to their referents
            but have an existence of their own, that they are "palpable," as
            Jakobson would say.

          The Zero-Degree of Painting

          The founding moment of Suprematism occurred in December 1915, at the "0.10" exhibition in Petrograd (subtitled "The Last Futurist Exhibition of Paintings," the show owes its name to the fact that its ten participants-including Vladimir Tatlin, who showed his first corner counter-reli ef th ere- were all seeking to determine the "zero degree," the irreducible core, the essential minimum of painting or of sculpture).

            Suprematism
          </h4>
          <p>
            A term coined by Russian artist Kazimir Malevich in 1915 to describe a new mode of abstract painting that abandoned all reference to the outside world. His new style claimed <strong>"the supremacy of pure feeling or perception in the pictorial arts"</strong> and rejected the deliberate illusions of representational painting. Using the basic components of painting’s language—color, line, and brushwork—he constructed a visual vocabulary of colored geometric shapes floating against white backgrounds, which he felt mapped the boundless space of the ideal.

            From Cubist Construction to Constructivism
          </h4>
          
          <div class="igBox">
            <p>
              Constructivism was a particularly austere branch of abstract art founded by Vladimir Tatlin and Alexander Rodchenko in Russia around 1915
            </p>
            <p>
              The constructivists believed art should directly reflect the modern industrial world. Vladimir Tatlin was crucially influenced by Pablo Picasso’s cubist constructions (Construction 1914) which he saw in Picasso’s studio in Paris in 1913. These were three-dimensional still lifes made of scrap materials. Tatlin began to make his own but they were completely abstract and made of industrial materials.
            </p>
            <p>
              By 1921 Russian artists who followed Tatlin’s ideas were calling themselves constructivists and in 1923 a manifesto was published in their magazine Lef:
            </p>
            <p class="mini">
              The material formation of the object is to be substituted for its aesthetic combination. The object is to be treated as a whole and thus will be of no discernible ‘style’ but simply a product of an industrial order like a car, an aeroplane and such like. Constructivism is a purely technical mastery and organisation of materials.
            </p>
            <p>
              Constructivism was suppressed in Russia in the 1920s but was brought to the West by Naum Gabo and his brother Antoine Pevsner and has been a major influence on modern sculpture.

                  Tatlin is already on the threshold of Constructivism. The frame remains, but the materials are no longer composed pictorially. An iron triangle projects into space, in contrast with a wooden rod set at an angle in the stucco surface; below and above are two further juxtapositions of curved metal and cut glass. Selection has the character of a demonstration: it first lists its materials, then allows intrinsic properties to suggest appropriate forms. "The material dictates the forms, and not the opposite," critic Nikolai Tarabukin wrote in a 1916 definition of Constructivism based on such works. "Wood, metal, glass, etc. impose different constructions." For Tatlin, machined wood was square and planar, and so suggested rectilinear forms; metal could be cut and bent, and so suggested curvilinear forms; glass was somewhere in between, with a transparency that might also mediate between interior and exterior surfaces. How different this materialism is from the ambiguity of Cubist constructions! Far from the "arbitrary," Tatlin sought to make his constructions "necessary" through this "truth to materials," an ur-modernist aesthetic that tended also to be an ethics and, after the Russian Revolution, a politics as well.

              "What happened from the social aspect in 1917," (Vladimir) Tatlin wrote, "was realized in our work as pictorial artists in 1914, when 'materials, volume, and construction' were accepted as our foundations." Such materialist foundations were achieved in Constructivist art, Tatlin implies, before they were established in Communist society.

                <p>
                  After 1914 Tatlin adopted the term "counter-relief," as if to
                  signal a dialectical advance in his constructions: just as the first
                  "painterly reliefs" exceeded painting, so the new "counter-reliefs,"
                  which extended from the wall, exceeded the painterly reliefs.
                  Sometimes these counter-reliefs were suspended across corners
                  with axial wires and rods [3). These "corner counter-reliefs" were
                  
                  complex constructions of metal planes, squared and curved, per pendicular and angular. Not painting, sculpture, or architecture, they were "counters" to all three arts that activated materials, spaces, and viewers in new ways. First shown in December 1915 at
                  "0.10: The Last Futurist Exhibition of Paintings" in Petrograd
                  (once St. Petersburg, soon to be Leningrad), where Tatlin vied
                  with Kazimir Malevich for leadership of the Russian avant-garde,
                  the counter-reliefs drew young artists into the experimental
                  ("laboratory") phase of Constructivism. If the painterly reliefs
                  
                  advanced the Constructivist notion of faktura, which, in contra-
                  distinction to Western "facture", stressed the mechanical aspect of
                  
                  the painterly mark rather than its subjective side, the counter-
                  reliefs advanced the Constructivist notion of construction, which,
                  
                  in opposition to Western "composition," stressed active engage-
                  ment with art rather than contemplative reflection of it. Yet to be
                  
                  developed was the third notion of Constructivism, tectonics, the
                  dialectical connection of Constructivist formal experimentation
                  with Communist principles of socioeconomic organization, but
                  this most difficult step in the Constructivist program had to await
                  the Revolution.
